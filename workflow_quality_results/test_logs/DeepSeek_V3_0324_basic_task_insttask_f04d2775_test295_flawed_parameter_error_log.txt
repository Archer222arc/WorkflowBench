Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unspecified input data by reading it, filtering it based on criteria, and validating it against a schema to produce a refined output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data by reading it, filtering it based on criteria, and validating it against a schema to produce a refined output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_filter for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_validator for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 38%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 51%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 47.9%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the file_operations_reader tool to read the input data as the first step in our workflow.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_reader failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Since the file_operations_reader failed, I'll try an alternative tool for reading the input data. I'll use the data_processing_parser which can also handle file input.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.

  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant:             Now that we've successfully read the input data, I'll proceed with the next step: filtering the data. I'll use the data_processing_filter tool.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {
    "filter_criteria": {
      "type": "basic",
      "conditions": []
    }
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 40 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_filter timed out, I'll try again with a simpler filter configuration to reduce processing time.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {
    "filter_criteria": {
      "type": "basic",
      "conditions": [],
      "timeout": 60
    }
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 51 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             Since the filter operation continues to time out, I'll proceed to the validation step using the data_processing_validator tool, which might be able to handle the raw input directly.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "schema": {
    "type": "basic",
    "fields": []
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             Since all three main tools in the workflow have failed, I'll attempt to use the file_operations_writer to generate a basic output file with the original input data, as a fallback solution to complete the task.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer
{
  "destination": "data/output.json",
  "data": {},
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_writer failed.
Error: PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions (required permission: execute)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since all attempted tools have failed and we're unable to complete the full workflow, I'll conclude the task execution with a status report. The task could not be completed due to persistent tool failures (reading, filtering, validating, and writing operations all failed).

Task status: Failed
Reasons:
1. Initial file read failed (OPERATION_FAILED)
2. Filter operation timed out repeatedly
3. Validation operation failed
4. Fallback write operation denied due to permissions

No further tools are available to attempt completion of this task.
