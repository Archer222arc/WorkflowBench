Description: Process the input data through three steps: validate for compliance, transform formats, and filter based on criteria, resulting in an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process the input data through three steps: validate for compliance, transform formats, and filter based on criteria, resulting in an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 59%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 46.9%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I need to start by parsing the input data since both the validator and transformer tools require a parser. I'll execute the data_processing_parser tool first with the default input path.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the data is parsed, I need to validate it for compliance. According to the workflow plan, the validator tool requires a parser, which we've already executed. I'll execute the data_processing_validator next. Since we're in an automated test environment, I'll use a default schema for validation.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",

}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Now that the data is validated, I need to transform it to the required format. According to the workflow plan, the transformer tool is next. I'll execute the data_processing_transformer with default parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: JSON format)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The transformation failed because the input format wasn't specified. I need to check the transformer tool's requirements to provide the necessary parameters. I'll get detailed information about the data_processing_transformer tool.

<tool_info>data_processing_transformer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

  - input_format (string): Input data format [REQUIRED]
  - output_format (string): Desired output format [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - transformed_data (object): Transformed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The transformer tool requires both input_format and output_format parameters. Since this is an automated test environment, I'll use the default format "json" for both parameters as specified in the task rules. I'll retry the transformation with these parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer input_format="json" output_format="json"</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",

  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Now that the data is transformed, I need to filter it based on criteria. According to the workflow plan, the next step is to execute the data_processing_filter tool. I'll use the default options parameter as specified in the tool's parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T14:08:46.107439",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 4,
    "total_tools_executed": 3
  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The task is now complete. I've successfully executed all required steps:

1. Parsed input data using data_processing_parser
2. Validated data for compliance using data_processing_validator
3. Transformed data formats using data_processing_transformer (after providing required parameters)
4. Filtered data based on criteria using data_processing_filter

All steps were executed successfully in sequence using default parameters as specified in the automated test environment rules. The processed data is now ready in the default output location.
