Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three steps: validate compliance, transform formats, and filter results, yielding an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

5. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
6. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 6/6 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 45.4%
- Critical Steps: 6

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Now that I have the parsed data, I need to validate it for compliance. According to the tool information, the validator requires a schema and the data to validate. Since this is an automated test environment with unknown input data, I'll use a generic schema that allows any valid JSON structure as a reasonable default. I'll pass the parsed data from the previous step to the validator.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Now I need to transform the validated data. According to the workflow, I should use the data_processing_transformer tool. I'll get its details first to understand its parameters.

<tool_info>data_processing_transformer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_transformer ===
Description: This tool is designed to transform data from one format to another while applying specific modifications.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - input_format (string): Input data format [REQUIRED]
  - output_format (string): Desired output format [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - transformed_data (object): Transformed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Now I need to transform the validated data. Since the task requires transforming formats and the tool requires input and output formats, I'll use the default JSON format for both as specified in the environment rules. I'll set input_format to "json" and output_format to "json" since we're working with JSON data.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Finally, I need to filter the transformed data. I'll get details about the filter tool to understand its parameters.

<tool_info>data_processing_filter</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_filter ===
Description: This tool is designed to selectively filter data based on specified criteria.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Now I'll execute the filter tool to complete the final step of the workflow. Since the task-specific filtering criteria aren't specified, I'll use the default empty options object as per the tool's parameters.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The task has been successfully completed by executing the required steps in sequence:
1. Parsed input data using data_processing_parser
2. Validated compliance using data_processing_validator
3. Transformed formats using data_processing_transformer
4. Filtered results using data_processing_filter

All tools executed successfully with default parameters as specified in the automated test environment rules. The workflow is now complete.

Final output: The processed data has been filtered and is ready for use. Since no specific output destination was required, the results are available in the tool execution context.
