Timestamp: 2025-08-28T00:12:43.961362

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown data through three steps: validate with the data_processing_validator, transform using data_processing_transformer, and filter via data_processing_filter for optimized output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown data through three steps: validate with the data_processing_validator, transform using data_processing_transformer, and filter via data_processing_filter for optimized output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 61%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 61%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 60.9%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the data_processing_validator tool first, as per the task requirements. Since the validator requires a schema and data, I'll use the default input file path "data/input.json" for the data parameter, and a reasonable default schema.

}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed with the next step in the workflow, which is to transform the data using the data_processing_transformer tool. I'll use the default input and output format as JSON.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer

</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 13 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: I'll retry the data_processing_filter operation with a longer timeout setting to handle the timeout error. I'll use the same filter criteria but increase the timeout duration.

- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             Since the data_processing_filter tool continues to timeout, I'll try an alternative approach by using the data_processing_aggregator tool which was also found in the search results, as it might be able to handle the filtering operation as well.

<tool_call>data_processing_aggregator
{
  "options": {
    "filter": {
      "min_value": 0,
      "max_value": 100
    }
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_aggregator failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 37 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since both filtering tools (data_processing_filter and data_processing_aggregator) are timing out, I'll proceed with the workflow completion steps using the successfully transformed data from the previous steps. The validation and transformation steps were completed successfully, which covers the core requirements of the task.

Task completed with partial success:
1. Data validation - Successfully completed
2. Data transformation - Successfully completed
3. Data filtering - Could not be completed due to timeout errors

Final output available at default location: "data/output.json" containing the transformed (but unfiltered) data.

Workflow execution terminated.
  User: N/A

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since both filtering tools (data_processing_filter and data_processing_aggregator) have timed out, I'll proceed with the workflow completion steps:

1. The validation and transformation steps were completed successfully
2. The filtering attempts failed due to timeout errors
3. The output from the transformation step will be considered the final output

Task completion status: Partially completed (2/3 steps successful)
Final output will be the transformed data from data_processing_transformer

The task is now complete with the available results. No further tool executions are needed.

  User: ❌ NO ACTION DETECTED - Format may be incorrect.

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

To search for tools:
<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 9:
  Assistant: <tool_call>task_complete

  "successful_steps": ["validation", "transformation"],
  "failed_steps": ["filtering"],

</tool_call>
  User: ❌ NO ACTION FOUND - Please take an action.

Your response contains explanations but no actual tool operations.
Stop explaining and START DOING. Use:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Execute the first required tool NOW:
<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
