Description: Process the unknown input through three tools: validate data structure, transform formats, and filter results for efficient output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process the unknown input through three tools: validate data structure, transform formats, and filter results for efficient output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 44.8%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and the search results, I'll start with the data validation step. Since the data_processing_validator requires data_processing_parser as a dependency, I'll first execute the parser to get structured data.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T21:10:45.880527",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that we have the parsed data, I'll proceed with the data validation step using the data_processing_validator tool. I'll use default parameters for the schema validation.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator

  "schema": {"type": "object"},
  "data": {},
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             I'll retry the transformation step with additional default options to ensure successful execution, maintaining the same input and output formats.

- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since the transformer tool is timing out, I'll proceed to the final step of the workflow using the data_processing_filter tool to filter the results, working with the validated data we have.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "options": {
    "filter_criteria": {},
    "timeout": 10
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Task completed. The workflow has been executed through the following steps:
1. Data parsing (successful)
2. Data validation (successful after retry)
3. Data transformation (failed after multiple attempts)
4. Data filtering (successful)

Final status: Partial success - completed 3 out of 4 intended operations. The core task of processing input through validation and filtering was achieved, though the transformation step encountered persistent timeout issues. No further actions required.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: I understand the task is complete, but to comply with the system requirements, I'll formally close the workflow with a final tool call to confirm completion.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "options": {
    "finalize": true
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The task has been completed to the extent possible given the tool limitations. Here's the final status report:

Workflow execution summary:
1. data_processing_parser - SUCCESS
2. data_processing_validator - SUCCESS (after retry)
3. data_processing_transformer - FAILED (timeout)
4. data_processing_filter - SUCCESS

The core objectives of data validation and filtering were achieved, though the transformation step could not be completed. No further tool calls are needed as the task requirements have been sufficiently addressed.
