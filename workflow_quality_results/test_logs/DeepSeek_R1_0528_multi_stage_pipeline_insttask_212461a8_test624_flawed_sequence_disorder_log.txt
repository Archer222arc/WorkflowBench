Prompt Type: flawed_sequence_disorder
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T20:42:23.998861

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'computation_analyzer', 'file_operations_writer']
Description: Process unknown input data through four stages: parse, transform, analyze, and write, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four stages: parse, transform, analyze, and write, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_writer (Semantic match: 32%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_transformer, network_validator
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 29%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 31.8%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer, file_operations_writer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start with the data_processing_parser tool since parsing is the first stage in the pipeline. This tool will handle parsing the unknown input data into a structured format.

I'll execute the parser with the default source path as specified in the environment rules.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: CSV format)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: I need to handle the parser error. Since the input format is unknown and the parser expected CSV, I'll search for a more flexible parser that can handle multiple formats or auto-detect the input format.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I notice that the data_processing_parser tool is still the most relevant option, but it failed earlier due to format issues. Since the input format is unknown, I need to use a tool that can detect the format first. The file_operations_reader tool might be able to handle this as it's designed to read various file types.

I'll execute the file_operations_reader tool to read the input file and detect its format.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T20:43:35.732918",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The file_operations_reader successfully read the input file. Now I need to parse this raw content into a structured format. Since the data_processing_parser tool previously failed due to format issues, I'll first get more information about this tool to understand how to configure it properly for format detection.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_parser ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to parse raw data from various sources into a structured format.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The tool_info shows that data_processing_parser requires a source parameter and accepts optional options. Since the file_operations_reader successfully read the input, I'll use its output as input to the parser. I'll specify format detection in the options to handle the unknown formats.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T20:45:57.838286",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: The parser executed successfully. Now I need to transform the parsed data as the next stage in the pipeline. I'll use the data_processing_transformer tool for this step. Since the task doesn't specify transformation details, I'll use default formats.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T20:46:13.250985",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The transformation was successful. Next, I need to analyze the transformed data. I'll use the computation_analyzer tool for this stage as mentioned in the initial plan. Since the task doesn't specify analysis details, I'll use default parameters.

<tool_call>computation_analyzer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ computation_analyzer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "metrics": {
    "mean": 56.79,
    "std_dev": 5.67,
    "min": 9.93,
    "max": 85.32
  },
  "patterns_found": 0,
  "confidence": 0.89
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The analysis stage is successful. Now I need to write the results as the final stage of the pipeline. I'll use the file_operations_writer tool to save the output to the default path.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_writer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_writer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T20:46:29.952961",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 4
  }
}

Current progress: 5 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.
