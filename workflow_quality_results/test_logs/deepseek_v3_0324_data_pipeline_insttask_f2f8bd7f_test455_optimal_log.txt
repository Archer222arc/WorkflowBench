Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through four tools: read files, parse data, transform formats, and validate against a schema for output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four tools: read files, parse data, transform formats, and validate against a schema for output.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 45%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 57%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 57%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 57%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 53.8%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

  Assistant:             Now I'll execute the final step in our pipeline - validating the transformed data using the data_processing_validator tool.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The data pipeline task has been successfully completed through all four stages:
1. Data was read using file_operations_reader
2. Data was parsed using data_processing_parser
3. Data was transformed using data_processing_transformer
4. Data was validated using data_processing_validator

All steps executed successfully with default parameters. The final validated output is ready in the system. Task complete.

=== TOOL CALL FORMAT HELP ===
I noticed you might be trying to use tools, but the format isn't correct.

CORRECT FORMAT for tool calls:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

For this task, you need to use these tools: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer, data_processing_validator

EXAMPLES:
<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets and 'tool_call' tags.
Please try again with the correct format.
=============================


Turn 7:
  Assistant: I understand the correct tool call format. However, in this case, the task has already been fully completed through all four required steps (reading, parsing, transforming, and validating the data) as shown in the previous successful executions. 

Since all steps were completed successfully, no further tool calls are needed. The data pipeline task is now finished.

Final status: Task completed successfully. All four tools executed in sequence with successful results. No further actions required.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I understand the correct tool call format. To confirm the task completion, I'll verify by checking the output file one final time:

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/output.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

    "total_tools_executed": 4
  }
}
