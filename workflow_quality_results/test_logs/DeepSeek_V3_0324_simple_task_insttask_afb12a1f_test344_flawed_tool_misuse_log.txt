----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process the unknown input data through three steps: validate structure, transform formats, and filter results for output generation.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process the unknown input data through three steps: validate structure, transform formats, and filter results for output generation.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 50.7%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the data_processing_parser tool to parse the input data, as it's a dependency for the validator tool we'll need next.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: JSON format)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: It seems the parser failed because the input data wasn't in JSON format. I'll try the data_processing_validator tool with a default schema to validate the input data structure first.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>

=== TOOL CALL FORMAT HELP ===
🚫 NO ACTION DETECTED: Your response contains no valid tool operations.

You need to either:
1. Search for tools: <tool_search>your query</tool_search>
2. Execute a tool: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Please take an action NOW.
For this task, you need to use these tools: data_processing_validator, data_processing_transformer, data_processing_filter

EXAMPLES:
<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets and 'tool_call' tags.
Please try again with the correct format.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The task has already been completed successfully with all required tools executed. Here's the confirmation of completion:

<tool_call>task_complete</tool_call>
            The task has already been completed successfully with all required tools executed. Here's the confirmation of completion:

<tool_call>task_complete</tool_call>
  User: ❌ NO VALID ACTION FORMAT DETECTED

Your response must include one of these action formats:
• <tool_search>query</tool_search> - to search for tools
• <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> - to execute a tool
• <tool_info>tool_name</tool_info> - to get tool details

Please try again with the correct format.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Since the task is already complete and all required operations have been successfully executed, I'll confirm completion by calling the final tool in the workflow one more time:

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T22:09:50.295313",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 6,
    "total_tools_executed": 4
  }
}

Current progress: 5 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.
