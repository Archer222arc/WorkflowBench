Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input through three tools: read using file_operations_reader, parse with data_processing_parser, and filter via data_processing_filter to generate an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unknown input through three tools: read using file_operations_reader, parse with data_processing_parser, and filter via data_processing_filter to generate an unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_parser for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_filter for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_converter
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 55.3%
- Critical Steps: 1

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

   Relevance: 0.51
   Parameters:
      - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}
   Returns:
      - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
      - metadata (object): Operation metadata
   Possible Errors:

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the first tool in the workflow: file_operations_reader. Since this is a file reading operation, I'll use the default file path "data/input.json" as specified in the environment rules.

<tool_call>
{
  "name": "file_operations_reader",
  "arguments": {
    "source": "data/input.json"
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_reader failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: I'll handle the file reading failure by using an alternative tool. Since file_operations_reader failed, I'll try file_operations_scanner which also reads files and returns data. I'll use the same default file path.

<tool_call>
{
  "name": "file_operations_scanner",
  "arguments": {
    "source": "data/input.json"
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_scanner executed successfully.
Output: {

    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: The file reading step was successful using the alternative tool file_operations_scanner. Now I need to proceed with the next step: parsing the data. The task specifies using a "data_processing_parser" tool. I'll search for this tool to confirm its availability and parameters.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 5:
  Assistant: I'll now execute the data_processing_parser tool to parse the data we obtained from the file reading step. Since the parser requires a source parameter, I'll use the output from the previous step as input. However, since the environment rules require using default parameters, I'll use the default file path "data/input.json" as the source.

<tool_call>
{
  "name": "data_processing_parser",
  "arguments": {
    "source": "data/input.json"
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {

    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The parsing step was successful. Now I need to proceed with the final step: filtering the data. The task specifies using a "data_processing_filter" tool. I'll execute this tool to complete the workflow. Since the filter requires options for filtering criteria, I'll use an empty default object as specified in the tool parameters.

<tool_call>
{
  "name": "data_processing_filter",
  "arguments": {
    "options": {}
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
