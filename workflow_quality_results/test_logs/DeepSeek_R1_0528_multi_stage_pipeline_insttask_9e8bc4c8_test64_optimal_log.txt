Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input through six stages: read, parse, filter, validate, analyze, and aggregate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
5. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
6. Execute data_processing_aggregator (Semantic match: 43%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 6/6 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 40.8%
- Critical Steps: 6

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the next stage: parsing the data. I'll use the `data_processing_parser` tool as indicated in the workflow plan. Since the parser requires a source, I'll use the same input file path as before.

<tool_call>
{
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "parameters": {
    "source": "data/input.json",
    "options": {}
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:52:41.880383",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the filter stage. I'll use the `data_processing_filter` tool as indicated in the workflow plan. Since the filter tool likely requires input data, and the parser just processed the input file, I'll use the same source path.

<tool_call>
{
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "parameters": {
    "source": "data/input.json",
    "options": {}
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:54:04.206862",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the validation stage. I'll use the `data_processing_validator` tool as indicated in the workflow plan. Since the validator requires the parser as a dependency (which we've already executed), I'll continue using the same source path.

<tool_call>
{
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "parameters": {
    "source": "data/input.json",
    "options": {}
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:54:20.697089",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 3
  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the analysis stage. According to the workflow plan, I should use the `computation_analyzer` tool. However, the plan indicates it requires both the parser and aggregator as dependencies. Since we haven't executed the aggregator yet, I'll first check the tool details to understand its requirements.

<tool_info>computation_analyzer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== computation_analyzer ===
Description: This tool is intended for analyzing and interpreting computation results.
Category: computation

Parameters:
  - precision (number): Calculation precision [OPTIONAL] default=2
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - result (object): Calculation or analysis result
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - CALCULATION_ERROR: Calculation failed
  - OVERFLOW: Numerical overflow

Dependencies: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the aggregation stage since the analyzer requires it as a dependency. I'll use the `data_processing_aggregator` tool as indicated in the workflow plan.

<tool_call>
{
  "tool": "data_processing_aggregator",
  "parameters": {
    "source": "data/input.json",
    "options": {}
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_aggregator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_aggregator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:55:52.990784",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 4,
    "total_tools_executed": 4
  }
}

Current progress: 5 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Now that the aggregator has been executed, I can proceed to the analysis stage using the `computation_analyzer` tool. I'll use the default parameters as specified in the tool info.

<tool_call>
{
  "tool": "computation_analyzer",
  "parameters": {
    "precision": 2,
    "options": {}
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ computation_analyzer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "metrics": {
    "mean": 47.12,
    "std_dev": 7.14,
    "min": 4.82,
    "max": 92.6
  },
  "patterns_found": 4,
  "confidence": 0.75
}

Current progress: 6 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The multi-stage pipeline task has been successfully completed. All six stages (read, parse, filter, validate, analyze, and aggregate) were executed in sequence using the appropriate tools with default parameters. The final analysis results are:

```
{
  "metrics": {
    "mean": 47.12,
    "std_dev": 7.14,
    "min": 4.82,
    "max": 92.6
  },
  "patterns_found": 4,
  "confidence": 0.75
}
```

This output represents the final result of the pipeline in an unspecified format as required by the task. No further tool execution is needed.
