Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown data by validating its structure, transforming it to a specified format, and filtering the results for efficiency.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown data by validating its structure, transforming it to a specified format, and filtering the results for efficiency.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 46.4%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

2. Transform the data (using data_processing_transformer)
3. Filter the results (using data_processing_filter)

However, both the validator and transformer tools require the data_processing_parser as a dependency. I'll start by executing the parser to read and structure the input data.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the data is parsed, I need to validate its structure. According to the tool dependencies, the validator requires the parser to run first, which we've done. I'll now execute the validator tool. Since we're in an automated environment, I need to provide a schema for validation. I'll use a generic JSON schema that validates basic object structure.

- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I need to handle the timeout error for the validator tool. Since the task requires validating the data structure, I'll try an alternative approach by using the network_validator tool which also performs validation but might have different performance characteristics. I'll use the default schema and data parameters.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I need to address the recurring timeout issues. Since both validation and transformation tools are timing out, I'll first check if the data is too large by using the data_processing_filter tool to reduce its size before attempting further operations. This might resolve the timeout problems.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: The filtering operation succeeded, which likely reduced the data size. Now I'll retry the data_processing_transformer tool to convert the filtered data to the required format (JSON) before validation. This should address the previous issues.

}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Now that the data is transformed, I'll retry the validation step using the data_processing_validator tool. The filtered and transformed data should now be in a suitable format for validation.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: I need to resolve the recurring issues with data format conversion and validation. Since the task requires CSV format for validation but transformation to CSV failed, I'll use the data_processing_filter tool again to prepare the data differently before validation. This might help bypass the format conversion issues.
