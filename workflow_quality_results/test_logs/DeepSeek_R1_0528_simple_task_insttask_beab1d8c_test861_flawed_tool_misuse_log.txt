Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three steps: validate for schema compliance, transform formats, and filter results for clarity, yielding an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 57%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 45.7%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I need to start by parsing the input data since both the validator and transformer tools require parsed/structured data. The data_processing_parser tool is essential for this first step. I'll execute it with the required source parameter using the default input path.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T22:10:46.797444",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the input data is parsed, I need to validate it for schema compliance. The data_processing_validator tool requires a schema, but since this is an automated test environment with unknown input data, I'll use a generic JSON Schema that allows any valid JSON structure as a reasonable default.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T22:11:43.097812",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Now that the data is validated, I need to transform it. The data_processing_transformer tool requires input and output formats. Since the task mentions "transform formats" and we're in an automated test environment, I'll use the default JSON format for both input and output.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T22:11:50.970476",
  "execution_context": {

Turn 7:
  Assistant: I need to execute the data_processing tool as instructed, but first I should verify its parameters since the previous tool calls didn't specify any. I'll check the tool details before execution.

<tool_info>data_processing_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_validator ===
Description: This tool is used to validate data against a defined schema to ensure its correctness and integrity.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
  - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - valid (boolean): Whether data is valid
  - errors (array): Validation errors if any
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
