Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unspecified input data through five tools: read, parse, transform, filter, and validate, resulting in a structured output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data through five tools: read, parse, transform, filter, and validate, resulting in a structured output format.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 40%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 44%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
5. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 5/5 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 43.4%
- Critical Steps: 5

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

=== TOOL CALL FORMAT HELP ===
🚫 NO ACTION DETECTED: Your response contains no valid tool operations.

You need to either:
1. Search for tools: <tool_search>your query</tool_search>
2. Execute a tool: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Please take an action NOW.
For this task, you need to use these tools: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer, data_processing_filter, data_processing_validator

EXAMPLES:
<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets and 'tool_call' tags.
Please try again with the correct format.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Since all 5 tools have been executed successfully, the task is complete, and there's no need for further tool execution. However, to follow the format and indicate the completion of the task in a way that aligns with the instructions, I will reiterate the last tool call that was made, which was the data_processing_validator. But since the task is complete and no further action is required, the appropriate response should acknowledge this completion without needing to execute another tool. Given the constraints of the format, the final step to explicitly state completion is challenging without deviating from the instructions. Thus, the focus shifts to ensuring that the process followed the guidelines up to the point of completion. 

Given the strict format requirements and the completion of the task, the response should reflect the finalization of the process. However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in how to conclude the task within the provided format constraints. The execution of tools has concluded, and the data pipeline task is finished.
