Description: Process unknown data through file operations, transform formats using a data transformer, and validate against a schema for compliance. Output remains unspecified.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown data through file operations, transform formats using a data transformer, and validate against a schema for compliance. Output remains unspecified.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 41%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
5. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
6. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 6/6 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 42.5%
- Critical Steps: 6

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start by reading the input data using the file_operations_reader tool. This is the most relevant tool for the first step of reading data from the input source.

I'll use the default file path "data/input.json" as specified in the environment rules.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_reader failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 39 seconds)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: I'll handle the timeout error by retrying the file read operation. Since the task requires reading input data as the first step, I'll attempt to read the file again with the same tool but will consider alternative tools if this fails again.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {

    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I'll now proceed to the next step: parsing and validating the data. Based on the workflow plan and tool search results, I need to use the data_processing_parser tool to parse the raw data we just read. This tool is required before we can perform transformations or validations.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",

  Assistant: Now I need to validate the transformed data against a schema for compliance. Based on the workflow plan, I'll use the data_processing_validator tool. This tool requires the data_processing_parser which we've already executed.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T03:14:47.860000",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 4,
    "total_tools_executed": 3
  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: The data pipeline has been successfully processed through all required stages: reading, parsing, transforming, and validating. The final step is to write the output. I'll use the file_operations_writer tool to save the processed data to the default output path.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_writer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_writer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T03:14:56.564060",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 4
  }
}

Current progress: 5 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The data pipeline task has been successfully completed through all required stages:

1. Input data read from "data/input.json" using file_operations_reader
2. Data parsed and structured using data_processing_parser
3. Data transformed using data_processing_transformer
4. Data validated against schema using data_processing_validator
5. Final result written to "data/output.json" using file_operations_writer

All steps executed successfully with default parameters as specified. No further actions required.
