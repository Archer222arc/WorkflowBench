Timestamp: 2025-08-21T18:23:12.436756

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_parser']
Description: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate it against a schema, and parse the output into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate it against a schema, and parse the output into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 48%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 50.2%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the network_fetcher tool to retrieve the API data as the first step in the workflow.

<tool_call>network_fetcher
{
  "source": "https://api.example.com/data",
  "timeout": 30,
  "retry_count": 3,
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_fetcher failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Since the network_fetcher failed and the alternative search didn't provide a better tool for API fetching, I'll proceed with the next step in the original plan which is data validation. I'll use the data_processing_validator tool to validate some sample data since we couldn't fetch real data from the API.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {

  },
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "test"
  },
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 25 seconds)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Since both the network fetch and validation steps failed, I'll try the final step in the original plan - data parsing - using the data_processing_parser tool with some sample data.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "input": {"raw_data": "sample data"},
  "format": "json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 12 seconds)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since all three primary tools in the workflow (network_fetcher, data_processing_validator, and data_processing_parser) have failed with timeout errors, I'll attempt a different approach by searching for alternative data processing tools that might be more reliable.

Final error summary:
1. network_fetcher - OPERATION_FAILED
2. data_processing_validator - TIMEOUT
3. data_processing_parser - TIMEOUT

No further tools will be executed as the task cannot be completed under current conditions.
