Timestamp: 2025-08-28T12:35:57.675908

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_parser']
Description: Integrate an API to process unknown input data through three tools: fetch data, validate against schema, and parse for structured output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to process unknown input data through three tools: fetch data, validate against schema, and parse for structured output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 52.4%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

----------------------------------------

Turn 1:
  Assistant: To begin the task of integrating an API to process unknown input data, we first need to fetch the data. The workflow execution plan suggests starting with a tool that can validate data, but given the context, it seems logical to first fetch the data from the API and then proceed with validation and parsing.

Let's search for a tool that can fetch data from an API:

<tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

To search for tools:
<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 8:
  Assistant: <tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Let's try to execute the `data_processing_parser` tool to parse the fetched
            Let's try to execute the `data_processing_parser` tool to parse the fetched
  User: ❌ NO VALID ACTION FORMAT DETECTED

Your response must include one of these action formats:
• <tool_search>query</tool_search> - to search for tools
• <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> - to execute a tool
• <tool_info>tool_name</tool_info> - to get tool details

Please try again with the correct format.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 10:
  Assistant: <tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",

}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
