Proceed with the task using the defaults above.\n\n    EXECUTION MODE:\n    - Execute ONE tool at a time\n    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution\n    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next\n    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. Analyze the task requirements\n    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do\n    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow\n    4. Wait for feedback\n    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool\n    6. Continue until the task is complete\n    7. Indicate when finished\n\n    \n\n    ## Workflow Execution Plan\n\n    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 34%)\n   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation\n   - Confidence: High (85.0%)\n2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 46%)\n   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation\n   - Confidence: High (80.0%)\n3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)\n   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation\n   - Confidence: High (80.0%)\n4. Execute computation_calculator (Semantic match: 29%)\n   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation\n   - Requires: data_processing_parser, network_validator\n   - Confidence: High (80.0%)\n5. Execute data_processing_aggregator (Semantic match: 47%)\n   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation\n   - Requires: data_processing_parser\n   - Confidence: High (80.0%)\n\n### Execution Summary:\n- Semantic Search Usage: 5/5 tools\n- Average Semantic Score: 40.4%\n- Critical Steps: 5\n\n    ### Analysis Results:\n    - Tools selected using: Semantic search\n    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser\n\n    ### Execution Strategy:\n    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results\n    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail\n    3. Pay special attention to critical tools\n    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input\n    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback\n\n    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.\n\n    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.\n    \n\nBegin by searching for the first tool you need.",
