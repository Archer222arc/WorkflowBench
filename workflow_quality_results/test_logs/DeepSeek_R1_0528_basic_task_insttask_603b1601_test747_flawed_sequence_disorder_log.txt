Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data using file_operations_reader, then extract and structure with data_processing_parser, and finally filter results with data_processing_filter for an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data using file_operations_reader, then extract and structure with data_processing_parser, and finally filter results with data_processing_filter for an unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_parser for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_filter for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 58%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 59%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 57.5%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Conversation History:
----------------------------------------

Turn 1:
  Assistant: I'll start by gathering detailed information about the first required tool in the workflow. Since the task requires using file_operations_reader first, I'll retrieve its specifications to understand the required parameters and defaults.

<tool_info>file_operations_reader</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== file_operations_reader ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to read and retrieve data from files.
Category: file_operations

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found
  - PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the tool information, I'll execute the first step in the workflow by reading the input file. I'll use the default source path "data/input.json" as required.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",

  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the next step: data transformation using the parser tool. First, I need to understand the parser tool's requirements by retrieving its specifications.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_parser ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to parse raw data from various sources into a structured format.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Now I'll execute the data_processing_parser tool. Since the task requires processing the output from the previous step, I'll use the output from file_operations_reader as the source. However, since the parser requires a string source parameter, I'll use the default "data/input.json" path as the source, assuming it's the same input file.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The parser tool failed to process the input. I need to handle this error by first understanding why it failed. Since the parser requires structured input, I should verify the output format from the previous step. I'll check the file_operations_reader output details.

<tool_info>file_operations_reader</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== file_operations_reader ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to read and retrieve data from files.
Category: file_operations

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found
  - PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The parser tool failed, but I need to understand the parser's requirements better. The parser expects a source parameter, which should be the data to parse. Since the file_operations_reader returns data in its output, I should have passed that data to the parser instead of the file path. I'll retrieve the parser's tool info again to confirm.

  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The transformer tool requires the parser as a dependency, which has already failed. Since I can't use the parser, I need to find an alternative transformation tool that doesn't depend on it. I'll search for a standalone transformation tool.
