Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Transform unknown input data through file operations, data processing, filtering, and validation to produce an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Transform unknown input data through file operations, data processing, filtering, and validation to produce an unspecified output format.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 42%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 47.0%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The data transformation is complete, so the final step is to write the processed data to an output file. I'll use the file_operations_writer tool for this purpose.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_writer failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 7:
  Assistant: The file write operation failed, but I need to complete the pipeline. Since the writer tool failed, I'll try using the file_operations_converter tool as an alternative way to output the data. This tool can transform data formats and might handle the output differently.

<tool_call>file_operations_converter</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_converter failed.
Error: PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions (required permission: read)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I need to resolve the permission issue to complete the output step. Since both write tools failed, I'll check the data_processing_aggregator tool from the initial workflow plan to see if it can handle the output differently.

<tool_info>data_processing_aggregator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_aggregator ===
Description: Aggregator for data processing
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 9:
  Assistant: I need more information about the data_processing_filter tool since it was part of the initial workflow plan. This might help me find a different approach to complete the output step.

<tool_info>data_processing_filter</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_filter ===
Description: This tool is designed to selectively filter data based on specified criteria.
Category: data_processing

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The filter tool doesn't seem suitable for output operations. Since I'm having persistent permission issues with file writing tools, I'll try a different approach by using the network_validator tool mentioned in the file_operations_writer dependencies to check if I can output via an API instead.

<tool_info>network_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== network_validator ===
Description: Validator for network
