Task Type: multi_stage_pipeline
Prompt Type: flawed_missing_step
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T02:37:46.703922

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_transformer', 'computation_analyzer', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through five tools: parse, filter, transform, analyze, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through five tools: parse, filter, transform, analyze, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 29%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 50%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/2 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 39.5%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant:             Since the filter operation failed, I'll check if there's an alternative filtering tool available before proceeding. I'll search for alternative filtering tools.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             I'll use the computation_analyzer tool to perform the analysis step of the workflow, using default parameters.

<tool_call>computation_analyzer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ computation_analyzer failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: XML format)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant:             Since the analyzer requires XML input format but our data is in JSON (default), I'll first transform the data to XML format using the data_processing_transformer tool with output_format set to "xml".

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer {"output_format": "json", "input_format": "xml"}</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 56 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant:                         Since the timeout occurred during transformation to XML, I'll proceed directly to the final validation step using the data_processing_validator tool, which should work with the current JSON format.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 29 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant:                         Since multiple tools have failed (filter, transformer to XML, and validator), and we've executed the core parsing and transformation steps successfully, I'll conclude the workflow execution. The task has been partially completed with the following results:

1. Data parsing - Success
2. Data transformation (JSON) - Success
3. Filtering - Failed
4. Analysis - Failed (due to format requirements)
5. Validation - Failed

Final status: Workflow partially completed with 2/5 steps successful. No further tools available to complete remaining steps successfully. Task execution terminated.
