Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_transformer']
Description: Process unspecified input data through four operations: read with file_operations_reader, parse with data_processing_parser, filter using data_processing_filter, and transform via data_processing_transformer for an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data through four operations: read with file_operations_reader, parse with data_processing_parser, filter using data_processing_filter, and transform via data_processing_transformer for an unspecified output format.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 58%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 54.8%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant: The search results show that file_operations_reader is still the most relevant tool (0.61 relevance), but it previously failed due to permission issues. Since the task requires reading input data, I'll try using file_operations_scanner as an alternative reader tool, as it has similar file reading capabilities (relevance 0.43) and might have different permission requirements.

I'll execute file_operations_scanner with default parameters:
- source: "data/input.json"
- options: default empty object {}

<tool_call>file_operations_scanner</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_scanner executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_scanner",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T20:43:07.195826",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The file_operations_scanner successfully executed, but I notice it didn't return any actual data in the output. Since the next step requires parsing the data, I need to confirm what data format we're working with. I'll get detailed information about the parser tool to understand its requirements.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The data_processing_parser tool requires a source parameter, which should be the input data to parse. Since the previous tool (file_operations_scanner) didn't return the actual data content, I need to use the same input source that was used for scanning. 

I'll execute the parser tool with the default input source:
- source: "data/input.json"
- options: default empty object {}

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T20:43:27.493424",
