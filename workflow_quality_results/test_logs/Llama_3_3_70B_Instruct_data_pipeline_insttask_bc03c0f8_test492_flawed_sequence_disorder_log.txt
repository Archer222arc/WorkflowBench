Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_transformer']
Description: Process unknown input data through three steps: read with file_operations_reader, filter with data_processing_filter, and transform using data_processing_transformer to produce an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three steps: read with file_operations_reader, filter with data_processing_filter, and transform using data_processing_transformer to produce an unspecified output format.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 58%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 55.4%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_filter failed due to an input validation error, I will try to execute the data_processing_parser to parse the data into a suitable format before filtering.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 40 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_parser failed due to a timeout, I will try to execute the data_processing_transformer, which may be able to handle the data directly or provide an alternative processing path.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_transformer failed, I will try to execute the file_operations_writer to write the output, if any, to a file, which might help in debugging or provide a fallback option.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_writer executed successfully.
Output: {

  User: ❌ NO VALID ACTION FORMAT DETECTED

Your response must include one of these action formats:
• <tool_search>query</tool_search> - to search for tools
• <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> - to execute a tool
• <tool_info>tool_name</tool_info> - to get tool details

Please try again with the correct format.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Since the file_operations_writer executed successfully, I will now search for tools to see if there are any other options available to complete the task.
