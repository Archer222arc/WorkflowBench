Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'network_poster']
Description: Integrate an API by fetching unknown data, validating it against a schema, and posting the processed result in an unspecified format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API by fetching unknown data, validating it against a schema, and posting the processed result in an unspecified format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 50%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute network_poster
   - Requires: data_processing_transformer, integration_authenticator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 50.5%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, network_poster

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

      - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
      - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
      - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
   Dependencies: data_processing_parser

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant:             I'll use the data_processing_validator tool to validate the fetched data. Since we need a schema for validation, I'll use a default schema that checks for basic JSON structure.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 15 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant:             Since the data_processing_validator timed out, I'll try the alternative validation tool from the search results with a longer timeout setting.

<tool_call>network_validator {"timeout": 60}</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_validator failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: CSV format)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             I'll first convert the data to CSV format using the data_processing_transformer tool before retrying the validation.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer {"input_format": "json", "output_format": "csv"}</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 28 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:                         Since both validation approaches failed, I'll proceed with the next step in the workflow and attempt to post the original fetched data (in JSON format) to the API endpoint using the network_poster tool.

<tool_call>network_poster</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_poster failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 17 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant:                         Since all attempts to process and post the data have failed due to timeouts, I'll conclude the task with the following status:

Task completion status: Partially completed (data fetched but processing and posting failed)
Final state: 
- Successfully executed network_fetcher
- Failed to validate and transform data
- Failed to post processed data
- Multiple timeout errors encountered

The task cannot be completed due to persistent timeout errors in the test environment. No further actions are possible.

Your response contains explanations but no actual tool operations.
Stop explaining and START DOING. Use:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Execute the first required tool NOW:
<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
