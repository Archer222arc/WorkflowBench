Timestamp: 2025-08-27T20:43:10.848609

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer']
Description: Integrate an API to fetch data, validate its structure, and transform it into a desired format through three processing steps.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to fetch data, validate its structure, and transform it into a desired format through three processing steps.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 51%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 45.0%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since the primary data_processing_parser failed and there are no direct alternatives in the search results, I'll try executing the data_processing_transformer again with explicit format parameters to see if it can handle the input without the parser dependency.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer
{
  "input_format": "json",
  "output_format": "json"
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: CSV format)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I'll try executing the data_processing_transformer again, this time specifying CSV as the input format since the error indicates it expects CSV data.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer
{
  "input_format": "csv", 
  "output_format": "json"
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 26 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Since the data processing tools are consistently failing, I'll attempt to complete the task by using the network_fetcher output directly as the final result, as it was the only successful operation in the workflow. The task requirements have been partially fulfilled with the API data successfully fetched.

Task completion status: Partially completed (API data obtained but transformation failed)
Final output will be the network_fetcher result.

Task execution ended.
