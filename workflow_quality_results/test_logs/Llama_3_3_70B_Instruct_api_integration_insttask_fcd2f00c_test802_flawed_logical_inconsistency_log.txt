Task Type: api_integration
Prompt Type: flawed_logical_inconsistency
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T05:01:08.073035

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_parser']
Description: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate it against a schema, and parse it into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate it against a schema, and parse it into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 50.7%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the search results, I will use the `network_fetcher` tool to fetch data from the API. 

Since this is an automated test environment, I will use the default parameters specified earlier. The `source` parameter will be set to "https://api.example.com/data" and the `timeout` and `retry_count` parameters will use their default values.

<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_fetcher failed.
Error: NETWORK_ERROR: Network connection failed (connection to service failed)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Since the `network_fetcher` tool failed due to a network connection error, I will try to execute it again after checking if there's an alternative tool that can handle network errors. However, given the tools listed, `network_fetcher` seems to be the most suitable for fetching data from an API.

Before trying again, I'll check the details of `network_fetcher` to see if there are any specific options or parameters that can help mitigate the network connection issue.

<tool_info>network_fetcher</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

Description: To retrieve data from a specified source over the network.
Category: network

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - timeout (number): Operation timeout in seconds [OPTIONAL] default=30
  - retry_count (number): Number of retries [OPTIONAL] default=3
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - NETWORK_ERROR: Network connection failed
  - INVALID_RESPONSE: Invalid response from server

  User: ❌ NO VALID ACTION FORMAT DETECTED

Your response must include one of these action formats:
• <tool_search>query</tool_search> - to search for tools
• <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> - to execute a tool
• <tool_info>tool_name</tool_info> - to get tool details

Please try again with the correct format.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Given the information about `network_fetcher`, I notice that it has a `retry_count` parameter with a default value of 3.
