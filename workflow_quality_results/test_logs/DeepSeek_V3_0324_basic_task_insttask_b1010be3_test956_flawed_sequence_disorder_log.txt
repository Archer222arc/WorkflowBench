Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through four tools: read, parse, filter, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four tools: read, parse, filter, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_parser for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_filter for final output
5. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 40%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 49.2%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed with the next step in the workflow - using the data_processing_parser to transform the data we just read. 

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:

}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             Now that the data has been successfully parsed, I'll proceed with the next step in the workflow - applying the data_processing_filter to process the parsed data.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             I'll handle the timeout error by first checking the tool details to understand its requirements and then retrying with a shorter timeout setting.

<tool_info>data_processing_filter</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_filter ===
Description: This tool is designed to selectively filter data based on specified criteria.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 8:
  Assistant:                         I'll retry the data_processing_filter with a shorter timeout setting and simpler filtering options to prevent the timeout issue.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {
    "timeout": 30,
    "filter_type": "basic"
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T01:11:38.445507",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 4,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant:             Now that the data has been filtered, I'll proceed with the final step in the workflow - using the data_processing_validator to validate the processed data.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T01:11:39.450879",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 3
  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The task has been successfully completed through the following workflow steps:

1. file_operations_reader - Successfully read input data
2. data_processing_parser - Successfully parsed data (after initial retry)
3. data_processing_filter - Successfully filtered data (after adjusting timeout settings)
4. data_processing_validator - Successfully validated the processed data

All four required tools have been executed in sequence with successful outcomes. The workflow is now finished. No further actions are required.

  User: ❌ NO ACTION DETECTED - Format may be incorrect.

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

To search for tools:
<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets.
