Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Transform unknown input data through six processing stages, utilizing file reading, validation, filtering, and analysis, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

- Average Semantic Score: 35.1%
- Critical Steps: 12

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             With the data validated, I'll now apply filtering using the data_processing_filter tool to refine the dataset.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 35 seconds)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             Since the data_processing_filter timed out, I'll proceed with the next step in the workflow and use the data_processing_transformer tool to transform the data.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer
{
  "source": "data/input.json", 
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 32 seconds)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since both filtering and transformation steps failed, I'll proceed to the final analysis step using the computation_analyzer tool to complete the pipeline.

<tool_call>computation_analyzer
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ computation_analyzer failed.
Error: OVERFLOW: Numerical overflow

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Since all transformation and analysis tools have failed, I'll attempt to write the processed data we have so far (from the validation step) to the output file using file_operations_writer to complete the task.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer
{
  "destination": "data/output.json",
  "data": {},
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_writer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 12 seconds)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: ## Task Completion Report

The multi-stage pipeline execution encountered multiple failures:
1. Successfully completed:
   - File reading (file_operations_scanner)
   - Data parsing (data_processing_parser)
   - Data validation (data_processing_validator)

2. Failed operations:
   - Filtering (timeout)
   - Transformation (timeout)
   - Analysis (numerical overflow)
   - Final output writing (timeout)

Given the repeated timeouts and errors in later stages, I'm concluding the task execution at this point. The pipeline partially completed with the first three stages successfully executed, but couldn't complete the full six-stage transformation due to system limitations.

Task status: Partially completed (3/6 stages)
