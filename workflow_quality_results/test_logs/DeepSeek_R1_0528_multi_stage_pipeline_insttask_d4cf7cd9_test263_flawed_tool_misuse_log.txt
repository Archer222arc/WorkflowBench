Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_validator', 'computation_analyzer']
Description: Process unknown input data through four stages: parse, transform, validate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format with no defined fields.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four stages: parse, transform, validate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format with no defined fields.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute computation_optimizer
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 33.4%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

  User: ❌ NO ACTION FOUND - Please take an action.

Your response contains explanations but no actual tool operations.
Stop explaining and START DOING. Use:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Execute the first required tool NOW:
<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I'll start the pipeline by executing the first required tool for parsing the input data.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T14:21:48.006272",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 4,
    "total_tools_executed": 4
  }
}

Current progress: 5 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Now that parsing is complete again, I'll proceed to the transformation stage as the next logical step in the pipeline.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T14:21:59.975214",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 5
  }
}

Current progress: 6 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the validation stage. Since the validator requires a schema but none is specified, I'll use a minimal permissive schema that allows any JSON structure as a reasonable choice for unknown data.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 6 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.
