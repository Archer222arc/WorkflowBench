Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process the unknown input through three steps: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter data, resulting in an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 49.4%
- Critical Steps: 1

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I need to start by parsing the input data since validation and transformation tools typically require structured input. The data_processing_parser tool is designed for this purpose and has the highest relevance for parsing raw data.

I'll execute the parser tool using the default source path "data/input.json" as specified in the environment rules.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T12:14:00.051628",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the input data has been parsed, I need to validate its structure. Based on the tool search results, the data_processing_validator tool is designed for this purpose. However, I need to understand its parameters better before execution.

<tool_info>data_processing_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Now I need to validate the parsed data. The validator requires a schema, but since this is an automated test with unknown input, I'll use an empty schema object as a default. For the data parameter, I'll use the output from the parser tool.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T12:15:13.060912",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The validation was successful, so now I need to transform the data format. According to the tool search results, data_processing_transformer is designed for this purpose.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: I'll execute the required tools in sequence as specified:

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: XML format)

- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: I need to handle the validation error. The validator failed because it expected XML input, but our data is likely in JSON format. I'll first transform the data to XML using the transformer tool before re-attempting validation.
