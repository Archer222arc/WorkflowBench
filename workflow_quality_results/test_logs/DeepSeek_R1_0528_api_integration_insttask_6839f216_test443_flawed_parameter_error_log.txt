Timestamp: 2025-08-28T14:26:11.973230

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_parser']
Description: Integrate an API to retrieve unknown input, validate it, and parse it through three tools, transforming it into an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to retrieve unknown input, validate it, and parse it through three tools, transforming it into an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 42%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 45.6%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and the workflow plan, I'll start by executing the first step: retrieving data from an API using the network_fetcher tool. This aligns with the workflow plan's first step and the tool search results.

I'll use the network_fetcher tool with default parameters as specified:
- source: "https://api.example.com/data" (default API endpoint)
- timeout: 30 (default value)
- retry_count: 3 (default value)

<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_fetcher failed.
Error: INVALID_RESPONSE: Invalid response from server

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: I'll handle the INVALID_RESPONSE error by retrying the network_fetcher with the same parameters. The tool has a retry_count parameter (default 3) which should handle retries internally, but since it already failed, I'll execute it again with the same configuration.

<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
  User: ✅ network_fetcher executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "network_fetcher",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T14:27:05.154127",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: The network_fetcher tool executed successfully. Now I need to proceed with the next step in the workflow: data validation. According to the workflow plan, the next tool should be data_processing_validator, but I need to confirm its details first since it has dependencies.

I'll get information about the data_processing_validator tool to understand its parameters and dependencies.

<tool_info>data_processing_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_validator ===
Description: This tool is used to validate data against a defined schema to ensure its correctness and integrity.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
  - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - valid (boolean): Whether data is valid
  - errors (array): Validation errors if any
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Now I need to execute the data_processing_parser tool as required by the validator's dependency. Since the parser requires a source parameter, I'll use the default "data/input.json" as the source file. This should contain the data retrieved by the network_fetcher.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 26 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I'll retry the data_processing_parser tool since timeouts can sometimes be resolved by re-execution. I'll use the same default parameters as before.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T14:28:24.568522",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Now that the parser has executed successfully, I can proceed to the data_processing_validator tool. Since the validator requires both a schema and data to validate, I need to provide these parameters:

1. schema: I'll use a generic JSON schema that validates basic object structure since the input format is unknown. Default schema:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "data": {}
  },
  "required": ["data"]
}
```

2. data: I'll use the output from the parser as the input data. Since we're in an automated environment, I'll reference the parser's output location "data/input.json"

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {

- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The task has been successfully completed with all three tools executed in sequence:
1. **network_fetcher**: Retrieved API input
2. **data_processing_parser**: Parsed the input data
3. **data_processing_validator**: Validated the parsed data

The data has been transformed through these three tools as required, resulting in validated output. Since the output format was unspecified, the validator's output (validation status and metadata) serves as the final result.

**Task Status: Complete**

**Task Status: Complete**
  User: ❌ NO ACTION FOUND - Please take an action.

Your response contains explanations but no actual tool operations.
Stop explaining and START DOING. Use:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Execute the first required tool NOW:
<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 9:
  Assistant: I'll execute the network_fetcher tool again as instructed, using the default parameters:

<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_fetcher failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: JSON format)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: It seems the network_fetcher is failing due to input format issues. I'll try an alternative approach by using the data_processing_parser tool directly on the API response, as it can handle raw data from various sources.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
