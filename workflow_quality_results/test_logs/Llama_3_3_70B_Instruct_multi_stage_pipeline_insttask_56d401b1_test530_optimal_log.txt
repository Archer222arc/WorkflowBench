Task Type: multi_stage_pipeline
Prompt Type: optimal
Timestamp: 2025-08-27T00:20:56.881322

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'computation_analyzer', 'file_operations_writer']
Description: Process unknown input through five tools: read, parse, filter, analyze, and write, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input through five tools: read, parse, filter, analyze, and write, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 41%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 47%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 39%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
5. Execute file_operations_writer
   - Requires: data_processing_transformer, network_validator
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/5 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 44.9%
- Critical Steps: 5

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, file_operations_writer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since the computation_analyzer and file_operations_writer failed, I will try to re-execute the computation_analyzer with potentially different parameters or dependencies. However, given the constraints of the task and the tools available, the next logical step would be to try and execute a different tool that might help in resolving the issue or providing an alternative path forward. But since the task involves a specific sequence and the tools are to be executed one at a time without deviation from the given sequence, and considering that both critical tools for analysis and writing have failed, it seems the task cannot proceed as planned. 

Given the failure of critical steps and the inability to proceed with the original sequence due to the dependencies and failures, the task as outlined cannot be completed successfully. Therefore, I indicate that the task is complete in the sense that all possible steps within the given constraints have been attempted, but the desired outcome could not be achieved due to the failures encountered.

=== TOOL CALL FORMAT HELP ===
🚫 NO ACTION DETECTED: Your response contains no valid tool operations.

You need to either:
1. Search for tools: <tool_search>your query</tool_search>
2. Execute a tool: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Please take an action NOW.
For this task, you need to use these tools: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_filter, computation_analyzer, file_operations_writer

EXAMPLES:
<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets and 'tool_call' tags.
Please try again with the correct format.
