Task Type: api_integration
Prompt Type: optimal
Timestamp: 2025-08-21T19:49:06.976780

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'network_poster']
Description: Integrate an API by retrieving unknown data, validating it against a schema, and posting the processed result in an unspecified format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API by retrieving unknown data, validating it against a schema, and posting the processed result in an unspecified format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 51%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute network_poster
   - Requires: data_processing_transformer, integration_authenticator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 50.6%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, network_poster

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Based on the search results, the most relevant tool for fetching data from an API is the `network_fetcher`. It has a relevance score of 0.62 and is categorized under 'network', which aligns with the task of retrieving data from an API.

Before executing the `network_fetcher`, I would like to confirm its parameters and ensure I'm using the correct defaults. According to the search results, the `network_fetcher` requires a `source` parameter, which should be the URL of the API endpoint.

Given the defaults provided, I will use "https://api.example.com/data" as the `source` URL.

Next, I will execute the `network_fetcher` tool with the default parameters.

<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
  User: ✅ network_fetcher executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The `network_fetcher` has executed successfully. The next step is to validate the data. I will execute the `data_processing_validator` tool.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-21T19:49:17.067355",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.
