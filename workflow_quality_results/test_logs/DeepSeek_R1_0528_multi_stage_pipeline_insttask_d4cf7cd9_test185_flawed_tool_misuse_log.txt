Task Type: multi_stage_pipeline
Prompt Type: flawed_tool_misuse
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T14:18:27.644905

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_validator', 'computation_analyzer']
Description: Process unknown input data through four stages: parse, transform, validate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format with no defined fields.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four stages: parse, transform, validate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format with no defined fields.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_filter
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 29%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute computation_calculator
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 31.1%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start with the parsing stage since it's the first step in the pipeline. The most relevant tool is data_processing_parser, which has high relevance (0.66) for parsing raw data into structured format.

I'll execute the parser tool using the default source path "data/input.json" as specified in the environment rules.

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the input data has been successfully parsed, I'll proceed to the next stage: transformation. According to the workflow plan and tool dependencies, the transformation tool requires the parser to run first. I'll now execute the transformation tool using default parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",

}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: The next stage is validation. I need to validate the transformed data. From the initial tool search, I see there's a data_processing_validator tool that requires a schema and data. Since we don't have a specific schema, I'll use a default schema path as per environment rules.

First, I'll get more details about the validator tool to understand its parameters better.

<tool_info>data_processing_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The next stage is validation. I need to validate the transformed data using the data_processing_validator tool. Since the tool requires a schema and data, and we don't have a specific schema, I'll use a default schema path as per environment rules. I'll use "data/schema.json" as the default schema path.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T14:22:45.769323",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The final stage is analysis. I need to analyze the validated data. Since the task mentions "analyze" and the initial workflow plan included computation_calculator, I'll search for analysis tools to confirm the best option.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: I'll use the computation_analyzer tool for the analysis stage since it has the highest relevance (0.52) for data analysis. According to its dependencies, it requires both data_processing_parser and data_processing_aggregator. I've already executed the parser, but I need to execute the aggregator first.

Let me get details about the aggregator tool:

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I'll execute the data_processing_aggregator tool first since it's a requirement for the computation_analyzer. This will prepare the data for analysis.

<tool_call>data_processing_aggregator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_aggregator executed successfully.

  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
