Description: Process unknown input data through three tools: validate structure, transform format, and filter content, resulting in an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three tools: validate structure, transform format, and filter content, resulting in an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 45.1%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the first tool in the workflow: the data processing parser. This tool will parse the input data into a structured format, which is required by the validator and transformer tools later in the workflow. Using the default input path as specified.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser source="data/input.json"</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T16:49:17.729871",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the input data has been successfully parsed into a structured format, I'll proceed to the next step: validating the data structure using the validator tool. Since the validator requires a schema parameter, I'll use a default schema file path as per the rules.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator schema="data/schema.json" data="data/input.json"</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I need to handle the validator failure. Since the validator requires parsed data but failed when using the raw input file, I should use the parsed data from the previous step. However, the environment doesn't pass data between tools automatically. I'll search for a tool that can store intermediate results.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 5:
  Assistant: I need to store the parsed data from the parser tool so I can be used by other tools. The file_operations_writer seems suitable for this purpose. I'll write the parsed data to a temporary location.

<tool_info>file_operations_writer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== file_operations_writer ===
Description: Writer for file operations
Category: file_operations

Parameters:
  - destination (string): Destination location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - data (object): Data to send [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found
  - PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions

Dependencies: data_processing_transformer, network_validator
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I need to write the parsed data to a file so it can be used by other tools. Since the file_operations_writer requires data, and I don't have the actual parsed data from the previous parser execution, I'll need to re-run the parser to get the data. But first, I'll execute the writer with default parameters.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer destination="data/parsed.json" data="{}"</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_writer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_writer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T16:51:03.767849",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: I need to store the actual parsed data from the parser execution. Since the previous writer call used empty data, I'll re-run the parser to get the data, then write it to a file. But I can only execute one tool at a time. I'll first re-execute the parser to ensure I have the data.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser source="data/input.json"</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T16:51:17.592900",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Now that I have the parsed data, I'll write it to a file so it can be used by other tools. I'll use the file_operations_writer with the parsed data.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer destination="data/parsed.json" data="{}"</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_writer failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: CSV format)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: I need to transform the parsed data into CSV format before writing it, as the file_operations_writer requires CSV. I'll use the data_processing_transformer tool to convert the JSON data to CSV.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer input_format="json" output_format="csv"</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T16:51:56.907263",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 3
  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Now that the data has been successfully transformed to CSV format, I'll write it to a file so it can be used by other tools. I'll use the file_operations_writer with the transformed CSV data.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer destination="data/parsed.csv" data="transformed_data"</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_writer failed.
Error: PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions (required permission: execute)

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.
