Timestamp: 2025-08-28T01:19:40.450321

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator', 'computation_analyzer']
Description: Process unknown input through five tools: read, parse, filter, validate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input through five tools: read, parse, filter, validate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 39%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 48%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 43%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
5. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 39%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 5/5 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 44.2%
- Critical Steps: 5

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the first tool in the workflow - the file reader. Based on the task requirements and default parameters, I'll use the file_operations_reader tool.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T01:19:42.153337",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that we've successfully read the input file, the next step is to parse the data. I'll use the data_processing_parser tool that was identified in the search results.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T01:19:43.744043",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant:             The next step in the workflow is to filter the parsed data. I'll use the data_processing_filter tool that was identified in the initial search results.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant:             The next step is to validate the filtered data. I'll use the data_processing_validator tool that was identified in the initial search results.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Now that the data has been read, parsed, filtered, and validated, the final step is to analyze it. I'll use the computation_analyzer tool that was identified in the initial search results.

<tool_call>computation_analyzer
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ computation_analyzer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "metrics": {
    "mean": 49.79,

    "min": 2.68,
    "max": 86.67
  },
  "patterns_found": 2,
  "confidence": 0.72
}

Current progress: 5 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: The multi-stage pipeline task has been successfully completed. All five tools (read, parse, filter, validate, and analyze) were executed in order with successful results. The final analysis shows metrics including mean (49.79), standard deviation (14.38), min/max values (2.68 to 86.67), and identified patterns with 72% confidence. 

Task status: COMPLETE

Turn 9:
  Assistant: I'll now proceed with the next tool in the pipeline - the data parser. Since we've already successfully completed all 5 required tools (reader, parser, filter, validator, analyzer) in this test environment I'll now conclude the task.

Task status: COMPLETED
All pipeline stages successfully executed:
1. file_operations_reader
2. data_processing_parser  
3. data_processing_filter
4. data_processing_validator
5. computation_analyzer

Final output metrics available in previous analyzer results. No further actions required.

  User: ❌ NO ACTION DETECTED - Format may be incorrect.

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

To search for tools:
<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The task has already been fully completed with all 5 tools executed successfully in sequence. Since no further actions are required, I'll confirm completion with the proper format:
