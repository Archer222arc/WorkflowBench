Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data through three steps: validate structure, transform format, and filter content, resulting in a compliant output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
5. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 47%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
6. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 47%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 6/6 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 41.1%
- Critical Steps: 6

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I need to start by reading the input data. Since the task requires processing through multiple steps, I'll begin with a parser tool to read and structure the input data. Based on the search results, data_processing_parser is suitable for this initial step.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",

Turn 4:
  Assistant: The data has been successfully validated. Now I need to transform the format as per the task requirements. I'll use the data_processing_transformer tool for this step. Since the task doesn't specify transformation details, I'll use default transformation that converts the data to JSON format.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The data has been transformed. The final step is to filter the data to produce the compliant output. I'll use the data_processing_filter tool for this step. Since no specific filter criteria are provided, I'll use default filtering that removes any null or empty values.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The task has been successfully completed. I've executed the required steps in sequence:

1. Parsed input data using data_processing_parser
2. Validated structure using data_processing_validator
3. Transformed format using data_processing_transformer
4. Filtered content using data_processing_filter

All tools executed successfully with default parameters. The final compliant output is ready at the default location "data/output.json".

Task complete.
