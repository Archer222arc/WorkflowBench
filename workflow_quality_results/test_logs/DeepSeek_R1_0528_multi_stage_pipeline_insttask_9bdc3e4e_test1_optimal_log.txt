Required Tools: ['data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_transformer', 'computation_analyzer', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through five tools: parse, filter, transform, analyze, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through five tools: parse, filter, transform, analyze, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 38%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
5. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 50%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 5/5 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 35.8%
- Critical Steps: 5

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start with the first tool in the pipeline: the data_processing_parser. This tool will parse the raw input data into a structured format, which is necessary before any filtering, transformation, analysis, or validation can occur.

I'll execute the parser using the default source path as specified in the environment rules.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:51:32.444005",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: I'll proceed with the next tool in the pipeline: the data_processing_filter. This tool will filter the parsed data based on specified criteria. Since the task requires filtering after parsing, and the parser executed successfully, I'll now execute the filter tool using default parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:52:18.869780",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I'll proceed with the next tool in the pipeline: the data_processing_transformer. This tool will transform the filtered data into a different format. According to the tool dependencies, it requires the data_processing_parser to have been executed first, which we've already done.

I'll execute the transformer using default parameters for input and output formats.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:53:15.414838",
  "execution_context": {

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed with the next tool in the pipeline: the computation_analyzer. This tool will analyze the transformed data. According to the dependencies, it requires both the data_processing_parser and data_processing_aggregator to have been executed. We've already executed the parser, but not the aggregator.

I need to execute the data_processing_aggregator first before proceeding with the analyzer. I'll execute the aggregator tool now using default parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_aggregator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_aggregator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_aggregator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:53:58.081434",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 3
  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Now that the aggregator has been executed, I can proceed with the computation_analyzer tool. This tool will analyze the processed data, and its dependencies (parser and aggregator) have both been satisfied.

<tool_call>computation_analyzer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ computation_analyzer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "metrics": {
    "mean": 53.43,
    "std_dev": 10.8,
    "min": 12.01,
    "max": 85.59
  },

}

Current progress: 5 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: The next step is the validation tool. I'll execute the data_processing_validator to complete the pipeline. This tool requires the data_processing_parser to have been executed (which it has), and it needs a schema and data to validate. I'll use default values as specified in the environment rules.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:54:31.423407",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 5
  }
}

Current progress: 6 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
