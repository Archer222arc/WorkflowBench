Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data by validating it, transforming formats, and filtering results to generate an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 52.5%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 5:
  Assistant:             Since the general parser failed expecting XML format, I'll try using the file_operations_reader first to read the raw file content before attempting to parse it. This will help us understand the actual format of our input data.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T00:13:38.783551",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             Now that we've successfully read the file, I'll check the output to understand its format. Based on the previous error, I suspect it's XML, so I'll use the data_processing_transformer to convert it to JSON format for easier processing.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 32 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since the transformer timed out, I'll try a different approach by first validating the data to understand its structure better before attempting transformation. I'll use the data_processing_validator tool.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant:             Since multiple tools have failed, I'll try a more basic approach by using the file_operations_reader again to get the raw data and then manually analyze its format. This will help us determine the correct processing path.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_reader failed.
Error: FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found (path: /data/file_operations_reader_750.dat)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant:             I'll attempt to use the default input path "data/input.json" with the file_operations_reader tool, as this is the standard path we should be using according to the test environment rules.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_reader failed.
Error: FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found (path: /data/file_operations_reader_764.dat)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant:             Since we're unable to read the input file and multiple tools have failed, I'll conclude this task execution. The automated test environment appears to have issues with file access and tool dependencies. 

Task status: Failed to complete due to:
1. Input file not found at expected location
2. Multiple tool execution failures
3. Timeout and operation failures

No further tools will be executed for this task.
