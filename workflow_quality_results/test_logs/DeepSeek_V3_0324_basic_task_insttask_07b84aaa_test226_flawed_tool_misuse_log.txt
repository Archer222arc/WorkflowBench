Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data through file_operations_reader, then extract with data_processing_parser, and finally filter results using data_processing_filter to generate unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through file_operations_reader, then extract with data_processing_parser, and finally filter results using data_processing_filter to generate unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_parser for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_filter for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_converter
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 58%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 57.6%
- Critical Steps: 1

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the first tool in the workflow - the file_operations_reader to read the input data. Using default parameters as specified:

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_reader failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Since the file_operations_reader failed, I'll try an alternative approach by first checking if the file exists using the file_operations_scanner tool before attempting to read it:

<tool_call>file_operations_scanner</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_scanner failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Since both file reading tools failed, I'll proceed to the next step in the workflow and attempt to use the data_processing_parser tool, which might be able to handle the input directly without requiring a file read operation first:

  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 21 seconds)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant:             Since all attempts to process the input data have failed, I'll try a different approach by using the data_processing_aggregator tool which might be more resilient to input issues. This will be my final attempt before concluding the task cannot be completed with the available tools:

<tool_call>data_processing_aggregator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_aggregator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since all attempts to process the input data have failed (file_operations_reader, file_operations_scanner, data_processing_parser, and data_processing_aggregator), and given that this is an automated test environment where I cannot request additional information or intervention, I must conclude that the task cannot be completed with the current tools and configuration.

Task status: Failed to complete
Reason: All required tool operations failed to execute successfully
Error summary:
1. File operations tools failed to read/scan input
