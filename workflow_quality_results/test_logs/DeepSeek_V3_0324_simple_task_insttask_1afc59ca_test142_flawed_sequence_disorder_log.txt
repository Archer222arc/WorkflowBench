Timestamp: 2025-08-27T20:41:55.814444

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data through three tools: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter based on criteria to produce an unspecified result.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three tools: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter based on criteria to produce an unspecified result.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 60%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 48.0%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that we have successfully parsed the input data, I'll proceed with validating it using the data_processing_validator tool. This will ensure the data structure is correct before we perform transformations.

- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Now that the data has been parsed, validated, and transformed, I'll complete the workflow by applying the data_processing_filter to selectively filter the data based on default criteria.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
  <options>{}</options>
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_filter failed, I'll attempt to use an alternative approach by first checking the transformed data structure before retrying the filter operation. I'll use the data_processing_validator again to ensure the transformed data is in the expected format.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
  <schema>{}</schema>
  <data>data/output.json</data>
  <options>{}</options>
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since both the filter and validation operations failed on the transformed data, I'll conclude the task execution at this point. The workflow has completed the parsing and transformation steps successfully, but encountered issues with the final filtering step. 

Task execution summary:
1. data_processing_parser - Success
2. data_processing_validator - Success (initial validation)
3. data_processing_transformer - Success
4. data_processing_filter - Failed
5. data_processing_validator (retry) - Failed

The task is now complete with partial success. No further actions will be taken.
