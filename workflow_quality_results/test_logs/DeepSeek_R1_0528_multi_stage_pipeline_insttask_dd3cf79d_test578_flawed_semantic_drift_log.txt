Task Type: multi_stage_pipeline
Prompt Type: flawed_semantic_drift
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T04:35:05.623937

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_aggregator']
Description: Process unknown input data through five stages: read, parse, filter, validate, and aggregate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through five stages: read, parse, filter, validate, and aggregate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 36%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 51%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 45%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
5. Execute data_processing_aggregator (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 5/5 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 46.6%
- Critical Steps: 5

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start with the first stage: reading the input data. The most relevant tool for this is file_operations_reader. I'll execute it using the default source path "data/input.json" as specified in the environment rules.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the next stage: parsing the data. Based on the workflow plan, I need to use the data_processing_parser tool. First, I'll get more details about this tool to understand its parameters and requirements.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I notice that the primary parser tool failed, but I see that data_processing_transformer might be able to handle parsing as part of its transformation process. I'll get more details about this tool to see if it can serve as an alternative parser.

<tool_info>data_processing_transformer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_transformer ===
Description: This tool is designed to transform data from one format to another while applying specific modifications.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - input_format (string): Input data format [REQUIRED]
  - output_format (string): Desired output format [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - transformed_data (object): Transformed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 7:
  Assistant: I see that the transformer tool depends on the parser tool, which already failed. Since I need an independent parsing solution, I'll look for another alternative. I recall that in the initial workflow plan, there was a tool called "data_processing_parser" that was recommended. Since the direct execution failed, I'll try to get more information about it to understand why it might have failed.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_parser ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to parse raw data from various sources into a structured format.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The parser tool requires a source parameter, which I provided as "data/input.json". Since it failed with "OPERATION_FAILED", I suspect the input data might be in a format that this parser doesn't support. I'll try executing the parser again but this time specifying the format option, using the default "json" format as per environment rules.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The parser tool failed again with the same error. Since the initial file_operations_reader was successful, I suspect the issue might be with the data format. I'll search for a tool that can help identify or convert the data format before parsing.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 10:
  Assistant: I notice that file_operations_converter might help with format conversion, but it requires knowing the input format. Since I don't know the input format, I'll try using file_operations_scanner to detect the data format first, as it can scan files for patterns.
