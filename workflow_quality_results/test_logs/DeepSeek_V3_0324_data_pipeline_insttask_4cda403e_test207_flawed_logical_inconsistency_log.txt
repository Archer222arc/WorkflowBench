Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data through four tools: read files, parse data, transform formats, and filter results, yielding unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four tools: read files, parse data, transform formats, and filter results, yielding unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 45%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 44%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 47.1%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

  Assistant: Now that we've successfully read the input file, the next step is to parse the data. Based on the workflow plan, I'll use the data_processing_parser tool with default parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant:             The parser failed, so I'll check for alternative parsing tools. I'll search for another data parser tool to handle the input data.

<tool_search>data parser alternative</tool_search>

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Since the primary parser failed and there are no direct alternative parser tools available, I'll try using the data_processing_transformer which includes parsing capabilities (as indicated by its dependency on data_processing_parser). I'll attempt to transform the data from JSON to JSON format as a basic parsing operation.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer
{
  "input_format": "json",
  "output_format": "json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since both parsing attempts failed, I'll try a different approach by checking the file content first to understand why parsing is failing. I'll use the file_operations_reader again to examine the raw data.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {"raw": true}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T03:53:30.997531",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             Since we still don't have the actual data content, I'll try a more direct approach by using the file_operations_scanner tool to analyze the file structure and content, which might help identify parsing issues.

<tool_call>file_operations_scanner
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_scanner failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 45 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Given multiple failures in reading and parsing the input data, I'll attempt to use the file_operations_converter tool as a last attempt to process the data, specifying JSON as both input and output format to potentially force a successful transformation.

<tool_call>file_operations_converter
{
  "input_format": "json",
  "output_format": "json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_converter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_converter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T03:53:34.229061",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Now that we've successfully converted the data, I'll proceed with the next step in the pipeline: filtering the results using the data_processing_filter tool with default parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T03:53:35.304828",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 6,
    "total_tools_executed": 3
  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.
