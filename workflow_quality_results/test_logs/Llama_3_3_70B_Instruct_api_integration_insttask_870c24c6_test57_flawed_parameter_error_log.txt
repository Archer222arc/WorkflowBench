Timestamp: 2025-08-28T02:01:04.049650

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_parser']
Description: Integrate an API to fetch unknown input, validate it against a schema, and parse it into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to fetch unknown input, validate it against a schema, and parse it into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 45%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 47.2%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since the `network_fetcher` executed successfully, the next step is to validate the fetched data against a schema. According to the workflow plan, the next tool to execute is `data_processing_validator`. However, before executing it, I need to ensure I have the correct details about this tool, especially since it requires another tool, `data_processing_parser`, and has specific parameters.

<tool_info>data_processing_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_validator ===
Description: This tool is used to validate data against a defined schema to ensure its correctness and integrity.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
  - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - valid (boolean): Whether data is valid
  - errors (array): Validation errors if any
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Given the information about `data_processing_validator`, it's clear that this tool requires `data_processing_parser` to be executed beforehand. Therefore, the next logical step is to execute `data_processing_parser` to fulfill the dependency requirement.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T02:01:45.080039",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

To search for tools:
<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Now that `data_processing_parser` has been executed successfully, the dependency for `data_processing_validator` is fulfilled. The next step is to execute `data_processing_validator`.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion
