Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data through three tools: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter based on criteria to produce an unspecified result.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three tools: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter based on criteria to produce an unspecified result.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 60%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 48.0%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

=== data_processing_parser ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to parse raw data from various sources into a structured format.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 3:
  Assistant: I'll now execute the data_processing_parser tool to parse the input data before validation, using the default source path "data/input.json".

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_parser failed, I'll try an alternative approach by using the network_validator tool which might handle raw data validation without requiring parsing first. I'll get more information about this tool first.

<tool_info>network_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== network_validator ===
Description: Validator for network
Category: network

Parameters:
  - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
  - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
  - timeout (number): Operation timeout in seconds [OPTIONAL] default=30
  - retry_count (number): Number of retries [OPTIONAL] default=3
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - valid (boolean): Whether data is valid
  - errors (array): Validation errors if any
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:

  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_filter tool doesn't have any dependencies and can operate without parsed data, I'll attempt to execute it with default parameters to see if it can process the input data.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: XML format)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since the filter tool expects XML format but failed, I'll try the data_processing_transformer tool to convert the input data to XML format first. I'll get information about this tool.

<tool_info>data_processing_transformer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_transformer ===
Description: This tool is designed to transform data from one format to another while applying specific modifications.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - input_format (string): Input data format [REQUIRED]
  - output_format (string): Desired output format [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - transformed_data (object): Transformed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 9:
  Assistant:             Since all available tools either require the data_processing_parser (which failed) or have specific format requirements that aren't being met, and given that we've exhausted the main tool options, I'll conclude that the task cannot be completed with the current toolset and dependencies.

Task status: Failed to complete due to:
1. Initial parser tool failure
2. All dependent tools requiring the parser
3. Alternative tools having incompatible format requirements

No further tools available to proceed with the workflow.
