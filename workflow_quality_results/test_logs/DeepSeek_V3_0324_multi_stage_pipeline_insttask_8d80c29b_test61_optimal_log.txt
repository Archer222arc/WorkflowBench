Task Type: multi_stage_pipeline
Prompt Type: optimal
Timestamp: 2025-08-21T20:44:04.607713

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_validator', 'computation_calculator', 'computation_analyzer']
Description: Process unknown input through four stages: parse data, validate schema, perform calculations, and analyze results for insights. Output remains unspecified.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input through four stages: parse data, validate schema, perform calculations, and analyze results for insights. Output remains unspecified.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute computation_calculator (Semantic match: 36%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, network_validator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 48%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 47.8%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

=== TOOL CALL FORMAT HELP ===
I noticed you might be trying to use tools, but the format isn't correct.

CORRECT FORMAT for tool calls:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

For this task, you need to use these tools: data_processing_parser, data_processing_validator, computation_calculator, computation_analyzer

EXAMPLES:
<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
<tool_call>computation_calculator</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets and 'tool_call' tags.
Please try again with the correct format.
=============================


Turn 7:
  Assistant: I understand the correct tool call format. However, in this case, the task has already been fully completed with all four tools successfully executed in sequence (as shown in the previous messages). 

The workflow was:
1. <tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call> - Completed)
2. <tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call> - Completed)
3. <tool_call>computation_calculator</tool_call> - Completed)
4. <tool_call>computation_analyzer</tool_call> - Completed)

Since all steps are done and we have the final analysis results, there are no more tools to call. The task is complete. 

Would you like me to perform another task or is there anything else you'd like me to do?
