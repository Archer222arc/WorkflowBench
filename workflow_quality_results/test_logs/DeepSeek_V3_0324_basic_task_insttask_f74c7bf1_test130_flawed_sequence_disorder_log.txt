Task Type: basic_task

Timestamp: 2025-08-27T22:09:33.346688

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unspecified input data through three operations: read with file_operations_reader, filter using data_processing_filter, and validate with data_processing_validator to produce an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data through three operations: read with file_operations_reader, filter using data_processing_filter, and validate with data_processing_validator to produce an unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_filter for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_validator for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 48%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 51.0%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the first tool in the workflow - the file_operations_reader to read the input data. I'll use the default file path "data/input.json" as specified in the task requirements.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T22:09:35.880260",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_filter failed and there are no better alternatives for filtering, I'll proceed to the next step in the workflow which is data validation. I'll execute the data_processing_validator tool that was identified earlier in the workflow plan.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "schema": {},
  "data": {},
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since both the filtering and validation steps failed, I'll attempt to complete the workflow by writing the original data we read to an output file using the file_operations_writer tool, as this is the only successful operation we've had so far.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer
{
  "destination": "data/output.json",
  "data": {},
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_writer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 24 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since all subsequent operations after the initial file read have failed, and we've exhausted the main tools in our workflow, I'll conclude the task execution with the following status:

Task completion status: Partially completed (only the initial file read operation succeeded)
Successful operations: file_operations_reader
Failed operations: data_processing_filter, data_processing_validator, file_operations_writer

The task cannot be fully completed due to multiple tool failures. No further actions are possible within the current tool constraints.
