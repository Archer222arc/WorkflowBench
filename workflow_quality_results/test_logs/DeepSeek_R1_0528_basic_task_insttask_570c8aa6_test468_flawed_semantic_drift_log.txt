Task Type: basic_task
Prompt Type: flawed_semantic_drift
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T16:48:27.318499

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data through file_operations_reader, then use data_processing_parser for structuring, and finally apply data_processing_filter for targeted transformations to generate unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through file_operations_reader, then use data_processing_parser for structuring, and finally apply data_processing_filter for targeted transformations to generate unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_parser for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_filter for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 58%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 56.3%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start by executing the file_operations_reader tool to read the input data. This is the first step in the workflow as specified.

I'll use the default file path "data/input.json" as required by the test environment rules.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T16:49:24.801104",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I need to proceed with the next step: applying the data_processing_parser to structure the data. Since I have the file_operations_reader output, I'll execute the parser tool next.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T16:50:05.439971",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the final step: applying the data_processing_filter for targeted transformations to generate the structured output. This completes the workflow as specified in the task.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T16:50:15.422836",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The task has been successfully completed by executing all required tools in sequence:

1. **file_operations_reader** - Read input data from "data/input.json"
2. **data_processing_parser** - Structured the raw data
3. **data_processing_filter** - Applied transformations to generate the final structured output

All tools executed successfully with default parameters as required. The structured output is now available in the system.

**Task Status: Complete**

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I need to indicate task completion since all steps are finished. Since there's no specific "task complete" tool, I'll use the standard completion format.

**Task Status: Complete**

All required tools executed successfully in sequence:
1. file_operations_reader - Read input data
2. data_processing_parser - Structured the data
3. data_processing_filter - Generated final output

Final output path: data/output.json  
All operations used default parameters as required.
