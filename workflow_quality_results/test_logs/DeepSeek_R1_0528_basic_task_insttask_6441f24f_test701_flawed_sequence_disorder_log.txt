Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data by reading with file_operations_reader, filtering with data_processing_filter, and validating with data_processing_validator for an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data by reading with file_operations_reader, filtering with data_processing_filter, and validating with data_processing_validator for an unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_filter for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_validator for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 51%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 52.7%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Now we need to validate the filtered data using the data_processing_validator tool.\n However, the tool_info for data_processing_validator shows that it requires a schema and the data to validate. \n Since we don't have a schema provided, we must use a default or generic one. Also, note that the tool expects the data to be in a certain format.\n\n But note: the task says \"validating with data_processing_validator for an unspecified output\". We don't have a specific schema.\n\n Since this is an automated test, we must use default values. We can assume a generic schema or use a default schema.\n\n However, looking at the tool_info for data_processing_validator:\n\n Parameters:\n   - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]\n   - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]\n   - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}\n\n We don't have a schema. We have two options:\n  1. Use a default schema that we assume exists (e.g., a file path for a schema, but we don't have one)\n  2. Use a tool to generate a schema from the data? But the task doesn't specify.\n\n However, note the task: \"Process unknown input data\". We don't know the input, so we cannot have a fixed schema.\n\n Since the environment rules say to use default values, we can use a default schema. But what schema?\n\n Alternatively, the tool might have a built-in default? The tool_info doesn't say.\n\n But note: the tool_info also shows a dependency: data_processing_parser. We haven't used that.\n\n However, we are in a bind. We must provide a schema. Since we are in an automated test, we can use a very simple schema that might work for generic data?\n\n But the tool might fail without a proper schema.\n\n Alternatively, we can search for a tool that generates a schema? But that might be overcomplicating.\n\n Let me check: the task says \"validating with data_processing_validator\". We are to use that tool. We must call it.\n\n Since we must use default parameters, we can try to pass an empty schema? But that would likely fail.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a tool to generate a schema from the data? Let's search for a schema generator.\n\n But note: the task does not specify generating a schema, so we are going beyond the task? However, without a schema, the tool cannot run.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a default schema that we assume is present at a default location? But the rules say for file paths use \"data/input.json\" or \"data/output.json\". We don't have a schema file.\n\n Given the constraints, I think we have to use a very simple generic schema that might work for any data? But that is not practical.\n\n Alternatively, we can skip the validation? But the task requires it.\n\n Let me reexamine the tool_info for data_processing_validator: it requires a schema. Without it, we cannot run.\n\n Since we are in an automated test, we can use a placeholder schema. For example, an empty object? But that might cause an error.\n\n We have to try and handle the error if it occurs.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a tool to generate a schema. Let's search for a schema generator.\n\n But note: the task is to use data_processing_validator. We must use that tool. We have to provide a schema.\n\n Since the task is to process unknown input data, we cannot know the schema.

Since we don't have a specific schema, we'll create a simple default schema that validates the CSV data structure. We'll assume the CSV has headers and rows with consistent columns.\n\nI'll create a basic schema for CSV data:\n- Validate that all rows have the same number of columns as the header\n- Validate that there are no empty rows\n\nBut note: we need to pass this schema to the validator.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start with the file_operations_reader tool to read the input data. This is the first step in the workflow as specified.

I'll execute the tool with default parameters:
- source: "data/input.json" (as per environment rules)
- options: {} (default empty object)

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {

    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I need to apply the data_processing_filter to transform the data. I'll first get the tool details to understand its parameters and requirements.

<tool_info>data_processing_filter</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_filter ===
Description: This tool is designed to selectively filter data based on specified criteria.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I notice that the data_processing_filter tool requires input data to process, but the tool information doesn't specify how to pass the data. Since we just read data using file_operations_reader, I'll assume the system automatically passes the output from the previous step as input to the next tool.

I'll execute the data_processing_filter tool with default parameters:
- options: {} (default empty object)

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: CSV format)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The data_processing_filter tool requires CSV input, but our file_operations_reader output is likely JSON since we read from "data/input.json". I need to convert the data to CSV format before filtering.

I'll search for a data conversion tool that can handle JSON to CSV conversion.

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: We have successfully read the input data, converted it to CSV, and filtered it. Now we need to validate the filtered data using the data_processing_validator tool.
 However, the tool_info for data_processing_validator shows that it requires a schema and the data to validate. 
 Since we don't have a schema provided, we must use a default or generic one. Also, note that the tool expects the data to be in a certain format.

 But note: the task says "validating with data_processing_validator for an unspecified output". We don't have a specific schema.

 Since this is an automated test, we must use default values. We can assume a generic schema or use a default schema.

 However, looking at the tool_info for data_processing_validator:

 Parameters:
   - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
   - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
   - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

 We don't have a schema. We have two options:
  1. Use a default schema that we assume exists (e.g., a file path for a schema, but we don't have one)
  2. Use a tool to generate a schema from the data? But the task doesn't specify.

 However, note the task: "Process unknown input data". We don't know the input, so we cannot have a fixed schema.

 Since the environment rules say to use default values, we can use a default schema. But what schema?

 Alternatively, the tool might have a built-in default? The tool_info doesn't say.

 But note: the tool_info also shows a dependency: data_processing_parser. We haven't used that.

 However, we are in a bind. We must provide a schema. Since we are in an automated test, we can use a very simple schema that might work for generic data?

 But the tool might fail without a proper schema.

 Alternatively, we can search for a tool that generates a schema? But that might be overcomplicating.

 Let me check: the task says "validating with data_processing_validator". We are to use that tool. We must call it.

 Since we must use default parameters, we can try to pass an empty schema? But that would likely fail.

 Alternatively, we can use a tool to generate a schema from the data? Let's search for a schema generator.

 But note: the task does not specify generating a schema, so we are going beyond the task? However, without a schema, the tool cannot run.

 Alternatively, we can use a default schema that we assume is present at a default location? But the rules say for file paths use "data/input.json" or "data/output.json". We don't have a schema file.

 Given the constraints, I think we have to use a very simple generic schema that might work for any data? But that is not practical.

 Alternatively, we can skip the validation? But the task requires it.

 Let me reexamine the tool_info for data_processing_validator: it requires a schema. Without it, we cannot run.

 Since we are in an automated test, we can use a placeholder schema. For example, an empty object? But that might cause an error.

 We have to try and handle the error if it occurs.

 Alternatively, we can use a tool to generate a schema. Let's search for a schema generator.

 But note: the task is to use data_processing_validator. We must use that tool. We have to provide a schema.

 Since the task is to process unknown input data, we cannot know the schema. Therefore, we must generate one.

 I will search for a tool that can generate a schema from data.

Tool Information:

=== data_processing_validator ===
Description: This tool is used to validate data against a defined schema to ensure its correctness and integrity.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
  - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - valid (boolean): Whether data is valid
  - errors (array): Validation errors if any
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Note: This tool requires both a schema and data to validate. Since we don't have a predefined schema, we'll need to create a basic one or use a default. In an automated environment, we can use a generic schema that validates basic CSV structure.</think>
We need a schema for validation. Since we don't have a specific schema, we'll create a simple default schema that validates the CSV data structure. We'll assume the CSV has headers and rows with consistent columns.

I'll create a basic schema for CSV data:
- Validate that all rows have the same number of columns as the header
- Validate that there are no empty rows

But note: we need to pass this schema to the validator. Since we're in an automated environment, we'll define a minimal schema object.

Alternatively, we can use a tool to generate a schema from the data? But let's stick to the task flow.

Since the task requires validation, and we must use default parameters, I'll create a simple schema object:

{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "rows": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "array",
        "minItems": 1
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["rows"]
}

But note: the validator might expect a specific schema format. Without knowing, we'll use this basic one.

Now execute the validator with:
- schema: the basic schema above
- data: the filtered data from previous step
- options: {}
