Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through five tools: read, validate, transform, calculate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 10/10 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 40.7%
- Critical Steps: 10

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Based on the search results, I need to execute the data_processing_parser before proceeding to validation, as it's a dependency for the validator tool. I'll parse the data that was read in the previous step.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The parser tool encountered an error. Since the parser is a dependency for subsequent tools, I need to investigate why it failed. I'll check the tool details to understand its requirements better.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Now that the data is parsed, I can proceed to the validation step. I'll use the data_processing_validator tool. Since it requires a schema, I'll use a reasonable default schema object for JSON data validation.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The data validation was successful. Next, I need to transform the data. According to the workflow plan and previous search results, the data_processing_transformer tool is appropriate for this step. It requires the parser as a dependency, which we've already executed.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
