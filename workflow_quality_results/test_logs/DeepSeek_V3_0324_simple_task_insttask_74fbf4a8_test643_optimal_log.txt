Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unspecified input data through three steps: validate structure, transform format, and filter results for clarity. Output remains unspecified.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data through three steps: validate structure, transform format, and filter results for clarity. Output remains unspecified.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 50%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 41.4%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by getting more details about the data_processing_validator tool since it's the most relevant for the first step (validation) and has the highest relevance score.

<tool_info>data_processing_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_validator ===
Description: This tool is used to validate data against a defined schema to ensure its correctness and integrity.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
  - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - valid (boolean): Whether data is valid
  - errors (array): Validation errors if any
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_validator has a dependency on data_processing_parser, I'll first execute the parser tool to get the input data in a structured format before proceeding with validation.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:32:38.040108",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Now that we have the parsed data, I'll proceed with the validation step using the data_processing_validator tool. I'll use default values for the schema and options parameters.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",

  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant:             Now that the data has been validated, I'll proceed with the transformation step using the data_processing_transformer tool to convert the data format.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:32:41.293894",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             Finally, I'll execute the data_processing_filter tool to complete the task by filtering the transformed data for clarity.
