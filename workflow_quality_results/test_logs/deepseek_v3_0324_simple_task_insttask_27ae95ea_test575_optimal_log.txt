Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process the unknown input through three steps: validate with the data_processing_validator, transform formats using the data_processing_transformer, and filter results via the data_processing_filter for the unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process the unknown input through three steps: validate with the data_processing_validator, transform formats using the data_processing_transformer, and filter results via the data_processing_filter for the unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 57%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 55.9%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             Finally, I'll execute the last tool in the workflow - the data_processing_filter. I'll use the default parameters to filter the transformed data.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Task completed successfully. The workflow steps have been executed in the following sequence:
1. data_processing_parser (with retry)
2. data_processing_validator
3. data_processing_transformer
4. data_processing_filter

All tools executed successfully using default parameters. No further actions required.

  User: 
=== TOOL CALL FORMAT HELP ===
I noticed you might be trying to use tools, but the format isn't correct.

CORRECT FORMAT for tool calls:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

For this task, you need to use these tools: data_processing_validator, data_processing_transformer, data_processing_filter

EXAMPLES:
<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets and 'tool_call' tags.
Please try again with the correct format.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: I understand the correct tool call format. However, I've already completed the entire workflow successfully by executing all required tools in sequence (validator, transformer, and filter) with their dependencies. The task is now fully complete.

Since all steps have been executed and all tools returned successful statuses, no further tool calls are needed. The workflow output is ready in the default output location "data/output.json".

Task completion status: SUCCESS
Workflow steps completed: 4
Final output: data/output.json

This concludes the automated testing workflow. No additional actions required.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: I understand the correct tool call format. To confirm the task is complete, I'll verify by executing the final tool again with the proper format:

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
