Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through five tools: read, parse, transform, filter, and validate to produce an unspecified output result.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through five tools: read, parse, transform, filter, and validate to produce an unspecified output result.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 38%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 44%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
5. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 5/5 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 43.0%
- Critical Steps: 5

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The next step is validation. I'll use the data_processing_validator tool to validate the processed data according to the pipeline requirements.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: The pipeline processing is complete, but we still need to write the final result to an output destination. I'll use the file_operations_writer tool to save the validated data to the default output path.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_writer failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: JSON format)

- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I need to handle the INVALID_INPUT error from the file_operations_writer. The error indicates the data isn't in JSON format as expected. I'll convert the data to JSON format using the file_operations_converter tool before writing it.

<tool_call>file_operations_converter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_converter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_converter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T13:11:24.454169",

  }
}

Current progress: 6 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Now that the data is converted to the appropriate format, I'll retry writing the output using the file_operations_writer tool with the converted data.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_writer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_writer",
