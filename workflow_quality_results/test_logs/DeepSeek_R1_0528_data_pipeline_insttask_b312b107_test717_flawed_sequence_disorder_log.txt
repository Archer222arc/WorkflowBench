Task Type: data_pipeline

Timestamp: 2025-08-28T13:03:18.991062

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through four tools: read, transform, filter, and validate, to produce an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four tools: read, transform, filter, and validate, to produce an unspecified output format.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 41%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 43.5%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start with the file_operations_reader tool to read the input data. This is the first logical step in the pipeline as we need to obtain the data before processing it.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: I'll now proceed to the next step in the pipeline. Since we've successfully read the input data, the next logical step is to parse and validate this data. Based on the tool search results, the data_processing_parser tool is designed for this purpose.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The parser tool failed due to a timeout. Since the data_processing_validator tool has a dependency on the parser and requires a schema, I need to find an alternative approach. I'll try using the data_processing_transformer tool directly, as it might handle both parsing and transformation. First, I'll get its details.

<tool_info>data_processing_transformer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 7:
  Assistant: The transformer tool requires the parser as a dependency, which previously timed out. Since I can't proceed with the parser, I'll try a different approach. I'll use the data_processing_validator tool directly for validation, but it requires both a schema and data. Since I don't have a schema, I'll need to find a way to handle this. First, I'll get the validator tool details.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The validator tool also requires the parser as a dependency, which is not working. Since I can't proceed with the parser-dependent tools, I'll need to find a standalone tool that can handle both parsing and validation. I'll search for a more comprehensive data processing tool.
