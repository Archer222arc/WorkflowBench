Task Type: data_pipeline
Prompt Type: optimal
Timestamp: 2025-08-21T16:14:47.518490

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through four tools: read with file_operations_reader, transform with data_processing_transformer, filter with data_processing_filter, and validate with data_processing_validator to produce an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four tools: read with file_operations_reader, transform with data_processing_transformer, filter with data_processing_filter, and validate with data_processing_validator to produce an unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 60%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 58%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 54.6%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I'll start by executing the first tool in the workflow - the file_operations_reader to read the input data.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I notice that the data_processing_transformer has a dependency on data_processing_parser. I'll first execute the parser to prepare the data for transformation.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {

    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant:             Now that the data is parsed, I'll proceed with the data transformation using the data_processing_transformer tool.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer
{
  "input_format": "json",
  "output_format": "json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Next, I'll execute the data_processing_filter to filter the transformed data. Since we already have this tool from our previous search, I'll proceed directly with the call.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {

- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             The final step in our pipeline is data validation. I'll execute the data_processing_validator tool to complete the task. Since we already have this tool from our previous search, I'll proceed with the call.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "schema": {},
  "data": {},
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
