Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data through three tools: validate structure, transform formats, and filter content, resulting in an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three tools: validate structure, transform formats, and filter content, resulting in an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 40.3%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and the tools found, I'll start by executing the data_processing_parser tool first since it's a dependency for other tools. This will parse the input data into a structured format that can be processed by subsequent tools.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_parser failed, I'll try an alternative approach by first validating the input data structure directly using the data_processing_validator tool, which might help identify any issues with the input data.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Since both the parser and validator tools failed, I'll attempt to use the data_processing_filter tool next, which might be able to handle the raw input data directly without requiring prior parsing or validation.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {

  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_filter executed successfully, I'll now attempt to transform the filtered data using the data_processing_transformer tool to convert it to the required format.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: CSV format)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

  Assistant:             The transformer failed because it expected CSV format. I'll retry the transformation specifying JSON format explicitly, since that's our default format for this test environment.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer {"input_format":"json","output_format":"json"}</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: XML format)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             Since the transformer is failing with format expectations, I'll now attempt to validate the data structure again, this time after the successful filtering operation, to better understand the data format we're working with.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: XML format)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant:             Given that multiple tools are failing with XML format expectations, I'll now attempt to process the data using the network_validator tool which might have different format requirements and could help identify the data structure.

<tool_call>network_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_validator failed.
Error: INVALID_RESPONSE: Invalid response from server

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant:                         Since all attempts to process the data have failed due to format issues, I'll conclude the task as incomplete. The system was unable to successfully validate, transform, and filter the input data due to incompatible format requirements across the available tools.

Task status: Failed
Reason: Incompatible data format (tools expected CSV/XML but input format couldn't be determined)
Tools attempted: data_processing_parser, data_processing_validator, data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer, network_validator
Successful operations: Only data_processing_filter completed, but subsequent steps failed

No further actions will be taken as all relevant tools have been exhausted.

  User: ❌ NO ACTION DETECTED - Format may be incorrect.

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

To search for tools:
<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]
