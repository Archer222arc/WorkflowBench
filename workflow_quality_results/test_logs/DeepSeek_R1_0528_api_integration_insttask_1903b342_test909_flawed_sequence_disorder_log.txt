Task Type: api_integration
Prompt Type: flawed_sequence_disorder
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T01:11:06.015112

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_parser', 'network_poster']
Description: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate its structure, parse it into a usable format, and post the processed result.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate its structure, parse it into a usable format, and post the processed result.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_poster (Semantic match: 37%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_transformer, integration_authenticator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 43%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute network_fetcher (Semantic match: 37%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 40.8%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser, network_poster

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

      - metadata (object): Operation metadata
   Possible Errors:
      - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
      - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
      - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start by fetching the API data using the network_fetcher tool. This is the first logical step since we need data before we can validate, parse, or post it.

I'll use the default URL parameter as specified in the environment rules.

<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
  User: ✅ network_fetcher executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "network_fetcher",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T01:12:07.100772",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that I have the API data, I need to parse it into a structured format. According to the workflow plan, the search results, data_processing_parser is the appropriate tool for this step. I'll get more details about this tool before executing it.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_parser ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to parse raw data from various sources into a structured format.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 4:
  Assistant: Now I'll parse the fetched API data using the data_processing_parser tool. Since the network_fetcher executed successfully, I'll use its output as the source for the parser. According to the environment rules, I'll use the default source path.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The parser failed, which suggests I need to validate the data structure before parsing. According to the workflow plan, data_processing_validator should be executed next. I'll get more details about this tool.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I need to validate the data structure before parsing since the parser failed. However, the validator requires a schema which I don't have. Since this is an automated test environment, I'll need to generate a schema from the raw data first. I'll search for a schema generation tool.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: I notice there's no dedicated schema generator tool available. Since the parser failed and I need to validate the data structure, I'll try using the data_processing_validator with a generic schema. For the automated test environment, I'll create a minimal schema that expects an object structure.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T01:14:15.914518",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The validator executed successfully, but I still need to parse the data into a usable format. Since the data_processing_parser failed earlier, I'll try using the data_processing_transformer tool to convert the data into a structured format. I'll get more details about this tool first.

  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 9:
  Assistant: I notice the transformer requires the parser as a dependency, which previously failed. Since I can't proceed with the transformer without the parser, I'll try the parser again with different options. I'll use the parser with the validated data from the validator.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
