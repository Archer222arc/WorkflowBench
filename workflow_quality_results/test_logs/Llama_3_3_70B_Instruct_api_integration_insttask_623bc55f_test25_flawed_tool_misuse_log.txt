Timestamp: 2025-08-28T12:43:29.129277

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_parser']
Description: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate its structure, and parse it into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate its structure, and parse it into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_router
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_filter
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 52%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 52.0%
- Critical Steps: 1

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Based on the tool information, I will execute the "data_processing_filter" tool. Since it doesn't require any specific input parameters other than the default options, I can proceed with the execution.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {

}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since the "data_processing_filter" tool executed successfully, the next step is to parse the filtered data into the desired format. According to the workflow plan, the next tool to execute is "data_processing_parser".

  User: ❌ NO ACTION DETECTED - Format may be incorrect.

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

To search for tools:
<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

=== TOOL CALL FORMAT HELP ===
⚠️ FORMAT ERROR: Tool call not detected.

You used <tool_search> correctly, but to EXECUTE tools you must use:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: After searching for tools, you need to EXECUTE them.
Example workflow:
1. <tool_search>query</tool_search> - Find tools (you did this ✓)
2. <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> - Execute tool (you need to do this)

For this task, you need to use these tools: network_fetcher, data_processing_validator, data_processing_parser

EXAMPLES:
<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets and 'tool_call' tags.
Please try again with the correct format.
