Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'computation_analyzer']
Description: Process unspecified input through four stages: read with file_operations_reader, parse using data_processing_parser, filter data via data_processing_filter, and analyze with computation_analyzer for insights.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unspecified input through four stages: read with file_operations_reader, parse using data_processing_parser, filter data via data_processing_filter, and analyze with computation_analyzer for insights.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
7. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 51%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
8. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 51%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 8/8 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 52.4%
- Critical Steps: 8

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

   Description: This tool is used to validate data against a defined schema to ensure its correctness and integrity.
   Relevance: 0.32
   Parameters:
      - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
      - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
      - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}
   Returns:
      - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
      - valid (boolean): Whether data is valid
      - errors (array): Validation errors if any
      - metadata (object): Operation metadata
   Possible Errors:
      - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
      - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
      - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
   Dependencies: data_processing_parser

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I notice that the data_processing_filter tool failed even with default parameters. Since it's the only filtering tool in the search results, I need to find an alternative approach. The computation_analyzer tool requires both a parser and aggregator, so I'll check if the aggregator can perform filtering-like operations.

  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_aggregator ===
Description: Aggregator for data processing
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The filter tool failure requires an alternative approach. Since the task requires filtering and the primary tool failed, I'll use the data_processing_transformer tool as an alternative. It can potentially perform data filtering through its transformation capabilities. I'll retrieve its details first.

<tool_info>data_processing_transformer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_transformer ===
Description: This tool is designed to transform data from one format to another while applying specific modifications.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - input_format (string): Input data format [REQUIRED]
  - output_format (string): Desired output format [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - transformed_data (object): Transformed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The transformer tool doesn't seem suitable for filtering as it focuses on format conversion rather than data filtering. Since the primary filter tool failed and no direct alternatives are available, I'll proceed to the next step in the pipeline. The computation_analyzer tool requires both a parser and aggregator, so I'll execute the data_processing_aggregator next.

<tool_call>data_processing_aggregator
{
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_aggregator executed successfully.
