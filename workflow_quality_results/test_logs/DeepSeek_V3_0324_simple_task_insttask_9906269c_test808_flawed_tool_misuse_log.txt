Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown data by validating its structure, transforming it to a specified format, and filtering the results for efficiency.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 42.2%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I'll use the file_operations_reader tool to first check if we can read the input file before attempting more complex parsing operations. This will help diagnose if the timeout was due to file access issues.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T00:59:45.424751",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Since we've successfully read the input file, I'll now proceed with the data validation step using the data_processing_validator tool to check the structure of the data we just read.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T00:59:46.468059",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             Now that the data has been validated, I'll proceed with the transformation step using the data_processing_transformer tool to convert the data to the specified format.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 42 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             Since the transformation timed out, I'll try a simpler approach by using the file_operations_converter tool which might be more lightweight for basic format conversion before attempting more complex transformations.

<tool_call>file_operations_converter</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_converter failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: XML format)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Based on the error message indicating the input is not in XML format, I'll now check the actual format of our input data using the file_operations_scanner tool to determine the correct transformation approach.

<tool_call>file_operations_scanner</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_scanner failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: CSV format)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant:             Given the repeated format-related errors, I'll now attempt to use the data_processing_parser tool again with explicit format specification to properly parse the input data before transformation.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser {"options": {"format": "json"}}</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 50 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant:             Given the persistent timeout issues with parsing and transformation tools, I'll conclude the task execution at this point. The workflow successfully completed the initial steps (file access and validation) but encountered technical limitations with the parsing and transformation operations. 

Task completion status: Partially completed
- Successfully executed:
  1. file_operations_reader
  2. data_processing_validator
- Failed operations:
  - Data parsing (timeout)
  - Data transformation (timeout)
  - Format conversion (input mismatch)

No further tool calls will be made as we've exhausted reasonable alternatives for this automated test environment. The task execution is now complete.
