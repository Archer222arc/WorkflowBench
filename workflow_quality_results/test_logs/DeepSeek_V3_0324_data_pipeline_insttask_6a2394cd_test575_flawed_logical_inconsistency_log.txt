Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through four tools: read, parse, transform, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four tools: read, parse, transform, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 39%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 44%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 42.3%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

  <source>data/input.json</source>
  <options>{}</options>
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 15 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant:             Since the data_processing_parser tool timed out, I'll try an alternative approach by first checking the tool details to understand its requirements better before retrying.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since the parser continues to fail, I'll search for an alternative parsing tool that might handle the input data better.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             Since the main parser tool keeps failing, I'll try using the data_processing_transformer as an alternative approach to process the data, even though it's typically used for format conversion. I'll specify JSON format for both input and output.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer
  <input_format>json</input_format>
  <output_format>json</output_format>
  <options>{}</options>
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since both parsing and transformation attempts failed, I'll try to validate the raw data we initially read to understand if there are any obvious issues with it. This might help diagnose why the parsing is failing.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
  <schema>{}</schema>
  <data>data/input.json</data>
  <options>{}</options>
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 43 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant:             Given that all data processing tools are failing (parser, transformer, and validator), I'll attempt to read the input file again with additional diagnostic options to understand its structure and content better.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
  <source>data/input.json</source>
  <options>{"diagnostic": true, "raw": true}</options>
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T15:22:56.913134",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Since we're unable to successfully process the data through any of the pipeline tools (parser, transformer, validator), and the file_operations_reader is the only tool working, I'll conclude the task cannot be completed with the current tools and input data configuration.

Task completion status: Failed
Reason: Unable to process input data through required pipeline stages (parse, transform, validate)
Successful steps: Only file reading operation completed
Failed steps: Data parsing, transformation, and validation

No further tools will be executed as the pipeline cannot proceed beyond the initial data reading stage. The task requirements cannot be met with the available tools and input data configuration.
