Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unspecified input data through three steps: validate structure, transform format, and filter results for clarity. Output remains unspecified.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data through three steps: validate structure, transform format, and filter results for clarity. Output remains unspecified.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 50%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 41.4%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

   Possible Errors:
      - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
      - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
      - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and tool search results, I need to start with the parser tool since both the validator and transformer depend on it. I'll get detailed information about the data_processing_parser tool before execution.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_parser ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to parse raw data from various sources into a structured format.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I'll execute the data_processing_parser tool to read and parse the input data. According to the task requirements and tool dependencies, this is the first step in the workflow. I'll use the default source path "data/input.json" as specified.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I need to handle the parser failure. Since the parser is a dependency for other tools, I'll first investigate why it failed by checking the file reader tool, as the parser might be failing due to input file issues.

<tool_info>file_operations_reader</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== file_operations_reader ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to read and retrieve data from files.
Category: file_operations

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found
  - PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 5:
  Assistant: I'll try reading the input data directly using the file_operations_reader tool since the parser failed. This will help determine if the issue is with the input file itself or with the parsing process. I'll use the default source path "data/input.json".

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T20:38:56.672819",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The file_operations_reader successfully read the input file. Now I need to validate the structure of this data. Since the parser failed earlier, I'll search for a validation tool that can work with the raw data.
