Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unspecified input data by reading with file_operations_reader, filtering with data_processing_filter, and validating with data_processing_validator for final output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data by reading with file_operations_reader, filtering with data_processing_filter, and validating with data_processing_validator for final output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_filter for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_validator for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 50%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 51.8%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Conversation History:
----------------------------------------

Turn 1:
  Assistant: I'll start by gathering information about the first required tool in the workflow. Since the task begins with file operations, I'll retrieve details about the file_operations_reader tool to understand its parameters and usage.

<tool_info>file_operations_reader</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== file_operations_reader ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to read and retrieve data from files.
Category: file_operations

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found
  - PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the tool information, I'll now execute the first step in the workflow: reading the input file. I'll use the required default path "data/input.json" as specified in the test environment rules.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/input.json"
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T22:10:35.387893",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the input file has been successfully read, I need to proceed with the next step: filtering the data. I'll retrieve information about the data_processing_filter tool to understand its requirements.

<tool_info>data_processing_filter</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_filter ===
Description: This tool is designed to selectively filter data based on specified criteria.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I notice that the data_processing_filter tool doesn't have an explicit input parameter for the data to process. This suggests it might be designed to work in a pipeline where it automatically uses the output from the previous step. Since we just executed file_operations_reader successfully, I'll proceed with the filter operation using default options.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
{
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The data_processing_filter operation failed. I need to investigate why this happened and find an alternative approach. Since the task requires filtering, I'll search for other filtering tools that might be compatible with our workflow.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I notice that the data_processing_filter tool doesn't have a parameter for input data, which might explain why it failed. Since we need to filter the data we read earlier, I'll try the data_processing_transformer tool instead, as it can modify data and might support filtering through its transformation options. I'll get more information about this tool.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I notice that none of the tools explicitly support filtering operations with input data parameters. Since the data_processing_filter tool failed earlier and doesn't accept input data, I need to reconsider my approach. The task requires filtering before validation, so I'll try to use the data_processing_validator tool with filtering options, as validation tools often include filtering capabilities. I'll retrieve information about this tool.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The validator tool requires both a schema and input data, but I don't have a schema defined. Since I need to complete the filtering step before validation, I'll try a different approach. I'll use the data_processing_parser tool to process the data we read earlier, as parsing often includes basic filtering and structuring of data. I'll retrieve information about this tool.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: I'll now execute the data_processing_parser tool to process the data we read earlier. Since the parser tool requires a source parameter, I'll use the same input file path that was successfully read by the file_operations_reader. This should parse the data into a structured format that can be used for subsequent operations.
