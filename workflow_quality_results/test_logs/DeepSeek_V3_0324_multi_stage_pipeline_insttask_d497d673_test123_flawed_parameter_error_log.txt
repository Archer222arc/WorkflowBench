Task Type: multi_stage_pipeline
Prompt Type: flawed_parameter_error
Timestamp: 2025-08-27T22:03:07.323000

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_transformer']
Description: Process unknown input data through four stages: read file, validate schema, filter content, and transform format, yielding an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four stages: read file, validate schema, filter content, and transform format, yielding an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 43%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 47.4%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I'll proceed with the data_processing_validator tool to validate the data we read in the previous step. Since we don't have a specific schema, I'll use a generic validation schema as default.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "*": {
        "type": "any"
      }
    }
  },
  "data": {},
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant:             The validation failed, likely because we didn't provide the actual data from the previous step. Let me first check the tool dependencies and requirements more carefully.

<tool_info>data_processing_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 6:
  Assistant:             I see that data_processing_validator requires data_processing_parser to be executed first. Let me execute the parser tool before attempting validation again.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since both the validator and parser tools failed, I'll proceed to the next step in the workflow (filtering) while noting that the validation step couldn't be completed. I'll search for a filtering tool to continue the pipeline.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Since all pipeline steps have failed, I'll conclude the task execution. The workflow could not be completed due to repeated operation failures at each stage. 

Task Status: Failed
Reason: All pipeline tools (reader, validator, filter, transformer) returned OPERATION_FAILED errors
Steps Attempted: 4
Successful Steps: 1 (file_operations_reader)
Failed Steps: 3

Finalizing task execution. No further actions will be taken.
