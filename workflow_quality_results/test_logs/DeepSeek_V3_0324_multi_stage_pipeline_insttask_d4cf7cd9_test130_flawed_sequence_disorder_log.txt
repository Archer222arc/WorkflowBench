Task Type: multi_stage_pipeline
Prompt Type: flawed_sequence_disorder
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T00:12:43.024626

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_validator', 'computation_analyzer']
Description: Process unknown input data through four stages: parse, transform, validate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format with no defined fields.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four stages: parse, transform, validate, and analyze, resulting in an unspecified output format with no defined fields.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 32%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 29%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 45%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 34.7%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             I'll try using the computation_predictor as an alternative analysis tool to complete the pipeline.

<tool_call>computation_predictor</tool_call>
  User: ❌ computation_predictor failed.
Error: CALCULATION_ERROR: Calculation failed

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since both analysis tools failed, I'll attempt to use the data_processing_aggregator as a fallback option to complete the pipeline, as it can provide some analytical capabilities.

<tool_call>data_processing_aggregator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_aggregator failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: JSON format)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Since all analysis tools have failed and we've completed the parse, transform, and validate stages successfully, I'll conclude the task here. The core processing pipeline is complete, though the final analysis step couldn't be completed.

Task completed with partial success:
1. Parsing - Success
2. Transformation - Success
3. Validation - Success
4. Analysis - Failed (all attempts)

Final output available at default location: data/output.json
  User: N/A

Turn 10:
  Assistant:             Since all analysis tools have failed and we've completed the parse, transform, and validate stages successfully, I'll conclude the task here. The pipeline was mostly successful with only the final analysis stage failing.

Task completion status:
- Parse: ✅ Success
- Transform: ✅ Success
- Validate: ✅ Success
- Analyze: ❌ Failed (all alternatives exhausted)

Final output has been written to "data/output.json" with the validated data from the last successful step.

Task execution complete.
