Task Type: multi_stage_pipeline
Prompt Type: flawed_semantic_drift
Timestamp: 2025-08-28T16:55:31.730141

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'computation_analyzer', 'file_operations_writer']
Description: Process unknown input data through five stages: read, validate, transform, analyze, and write, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a multi stage pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through five stages: read, validate, transform, analyze, and write, resulting in an unspecified output format.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 35%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 45%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 33%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute computation_analyzer (Semantic match: 32%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser, data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
5. Execute file_operations_writer (Semantic match: 30%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_transformer, network_validator
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 5/5 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 35.2%
- Critical Steps: 5

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer, file_operations_writer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start with the first stage: reading the input data. The most relevant tool for this is `file_operations_reader` with 65% relevance. I'll execute it using the default source path.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",

}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the next stage: data validation. I need to validate the data we just read. Since the workflow plan mentioned `data_processing_validator` but it wasn't in the search results, I'll search for validation tools.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I notice that `data_processing_validator` requires a schema and has a dependency on `data_processing_parser`. Since we don't have a schema and need to parse the data first, I'll execute the parser tool next. The parser will structure the raw data for validation.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The parser tool failed, so I need to find an alternative approach. Since the parser is a source parameter and we have the data from the reader, I'll try using the validator directly with the reader's output data. I'll use `data_processing_validator` with the data from the previous step.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 42 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: The validator timed out, so I need to try a different approach. Since both parser and validator failed, I'll proceed to the transformation stage directly using the data from the reader. I'll search for a transformation tool.
