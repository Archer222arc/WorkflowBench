Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown data through five tools: read, parse, filter, transform, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown data through five tools: read, parse, filter, transform, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 42%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 44%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
5. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 5/5 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 43.7%
- Critical Steps: 5

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

  User: ❌ file_operations_converter failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 10 seconds)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant:             Since both transformation tools failed, I'll proceed to the validation step with the filtered data as we've already completed reading, parsing and filtering. I'll execute the data processing validator tool.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: XML format)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The validator expected XML format but we have JSON data. I'll convert the data to XML format first using the file_operations_converter tool with explicit format parameters.

<tool_call>file_operations_converter
{
  "input_format": "json",
  "output_format": "xml",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_converter failed.
Error: FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found (path: /data/file_operations_converter_540.dat)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: Since we've encountered multiple failures in the transformation and validation steps, and the pipeline has already successfully completed the first three stages (read, parse, filter), I'll conclude the task at this point. The filtered data is available for further processing if needed.

Task completion status: Partially completed (3/5 steps)
- Successfully executed: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_filter
- Failed: data_processing_transformer, data_processing_validator

The workflow execution is now complete. No further tool calls will be made.

  User: 
=== TOOL CALL FORMAT HELP ===
I noticed you might be trying to use tools, but the format isn't correct.

CORRECT FORMAT for tool calls:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

For this task, you need to use these tools: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser, data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer, data_processing_validator

EXAMPLES:
<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets and 'tool_call' tags.
Please try again with the correct format.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: I understand the correct tool call format. Since we've already attempted all required tools in the pipeline and encountered failures in the later stages, I'll conclude the task execution here.

Final status:
- Completed successfully: Reading, Parsing, Filtering
- Failed: Transformation, Validation

The task execution is now complete. No further tool calls will be made.
