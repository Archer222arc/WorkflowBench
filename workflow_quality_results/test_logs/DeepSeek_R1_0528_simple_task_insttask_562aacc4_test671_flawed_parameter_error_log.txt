Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data through three steps: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter results for optimal output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three steps: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter results for optimal output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 46.5%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Now that the input data has been parsed, I'll proceed to validate its structure using the data_processing_validator tool. Since the validator requires a schema but no specific schema was provided, I'll use a reasonable default schema that validates basic JSON structure.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 46 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: I need to handle the timeout error. Since the validator tool timed out, I'll first check if there's an alternative validation tool available. I recall from the initial search that there's a network_validator tool that might work.

<tool_info>network_validator</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== network_validator ===
Description: Validator for network
Category: network

Parameters:
  - schema (object): Validation schema [REQUIRED]
  - data (object): Data to validate [REQUIRED]
  - timeout (number): Operation timeout in seconds [OPTIONAL] default=30
  - retry_count (number): Number of retries [OPTIONAL] default=3
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - valid (boolean): Whether data is valid
  - errors (array): Validation errors if any
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - NETWORK_ERROR: Network connection failed
  - INVALID_RESPONSE: Invalid response from server

Dependencies: data_processing_parser, data_processing_transformer
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The validation step failed due to a timeout. Since the network_validator requires the data_processing_transformer to be executed first (as per its dependencies), I'll proceed with the transformation step next. This might help prepare the data in a format that could make validation more efficient.

I'll execute the data_processing_transformer tool using default formats (input_format="json", output_format="json") as specified in the task rules.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The transformation step failed. Since both validation and transformation are failing, I need to verify if the parsed data is usable. I'll use the data_processing_filter tool to inspect the data from the parser. This might help identify if there's an issue with the parsed data structure.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_filter executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_filter",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T14:27:49.869962",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.
