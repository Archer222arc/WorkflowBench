Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unspecified input data through three operations: read with file_operations_reader, extract with data_processing_parser, and filter with data_processing_filter to produce an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data through three operations: read with file_operations_reader, extract with data_processing_parser, and filter with data_processing_filter to produce an unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_parser for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_filter for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 54%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 54.1%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 1:
  Assistant: I'll begin by gathering detailed information about the first required tool in the workflow. Since the task specifies using file_operations_reader first, I'll retrieve its specifications to understand the required parameters and output format.

<tool_info>file_operations_reader</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== file_operations_reader ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to read and retrieve data from files.
Category: file_operations

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out
  - FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found
  - PERMISSION_DENIED: Insufficient permissions

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the tool information, I'll execute the first step: reading input data using file_operations_reader. I'll use the default file path "data/input.json" as specified in the test environment rules.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/input.json"
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the next step: data transformation using the data_processing_parser tool. First, I need to retrieve its specifications to understand the required parameters.

<tool_info>data_processing_parser</tool_info>

- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Now I'll proceed to the final step: filtering the data using the data_processing_filter tool. First, I need to retrieve its specifications to understand the required parameters.

<tool_info>data_processing_filter</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_filter ===
Description: This tool is designed to selectively filter data based on specified criteria.
Category: data_processing

  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I'll now execute the final step using the data_processing_filter tool. Since the tool doesn't specify a source parameter and only has optional options, I'll use the default empty options object as specified in the tool information.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
