Task Type: simple_task
Prompt Type: flawed_tool_misuse
Timestamp: 2025-08-27T21:10:26.732163

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process the unknown input through three steps: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter data, resulting in an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process the unknown input through three steps: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter data, resulting in an unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 38.8%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

  Assistant:                         Now I understand the required parameters. I'll execute the data_processing_transformer with the correct format specifications (using JSON as both input and output format for this test).

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call> -input_format json -output_format json
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 28 seconds)

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant:                         Since the transformer continues to time out, I'll proceed to the final step of filtering the validated data using the data_processing_filter tool, which doesn't depend on the transformation step.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant:                                     Since all three steps (validation, transformation, and filtering) have been attempted and we've encountered issues with the transformation and filtering steps, I'll consider the task as complete with partial results. The validation step was successful, which completes the first required step of the workflow.

Task status: Partially completed
- Validation: Success
- Transformation: Failed (timeout)
- Filtering: Failed

The workflow execution is now complete.

Your response contains explanations but no actual tool operations.
Stop explaining and START DOING. Use:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Execute the first required tool NOW:
<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
