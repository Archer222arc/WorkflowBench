Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unspecified input data by reading it with the file operations tool, filtering it through data processing, and validating the output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data by reading it with the file operations tool, filtering it through data processing, and validating the output format.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_filter for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_validator for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 55%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_transformer
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 54.6%
- Critical Steps: 1

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant: I notice that the file_operations_reader tool failed due to input validation issues, likely because it expects JSON format but the input might be in a different format. Since the task requires reading unspecified input data, I need a more flexible tool that can handle different formats. I'll try the data_processing_parser tool that appeared in the first search results, as it's designed to parse raw data from various sources.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed (expected: JSON format)

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: I'm still encountering the same JSON format issue with the parser tool. Since both tools are failing due to input validation, I need to find a more fundamental file reading tool that doesn't assume a specific format. I'll search for a raw file reader.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 6:
  Assistant: I'm still not finding a suitable raw file reader. Since the tools are failing due to JSON format expectations, I need to investigate the file format issue further. I'll check the tool details for file_operations_reader to understand its requirements better.

<tool_info>file_operations_reader</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== file_operations_reader ===
Description: This tool is specifically designed to read and retrieve data from files.
Category: file_operations

Parameters:
  - source (string): Source location or identifier [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - data (object): Retrieved or parsed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 7:
  Assistant: I see that the file_operations_reader tool doesn't have any format-specific parameters in its definition. The INVALID_INPUT error suggests the tool expects JSON input but encountered something else. Since I need to proceed with the task, I'll try using the file_operations_converter tool to first convert the input to JSON format that the reader expects.

<tool_call>file_operations_converter
{
  "input_format": "auto",
  "output_format": "json",
  "options": {
    "source": "data/input.json"
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_converter failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 0 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The converter tool failed, so I need to find a different approach. Since the input data format is unspecified and causing issues, I'll try using the file_operations_scanner tool which might be more flexible for reading different file types.

<tool_call>file_operations_scanner
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_scanner executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_scanner",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T23:46:55.719597",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 3,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The file_operations_scanner executed successfully, but it doesn't provide the actual file content needed for further processing. Since I need the file content for the next step, I'll try the file_operations_reader again, but this time I'll specify the format in the options parameter to avoid the previous validation error.

<tool_call>file_operations_reader
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {
    "format": "auto"
  }
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_reader failed.
Error: FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found (path: /data/file_operations_reader_938.dat)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The file_operations_reader is now reporting FILE_NOT_FOUND, which suggests the input file might not be at the expected location. Since the file_operations_scanner worked earlier, I'll use it again to verify the file existence and get more information about the input file.

<tool_call>file_operations_scanner
{
  "source": "data/input.json",
  "options": {}
}
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_scanner failed.
Error: FILE_NOT_FOUND: Specified file not found (path: /data/file_operations_scanner_944.dat)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
