Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_parser', 'network_poster']
Description: Integrate an API by fetching unknown input, validating it, parsing it into structured data, and posting the unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API by fetching unknown input, validating it, parsing it into structured data, and posting the unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 36%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 40%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
4. Execute network_poster
   - Requires: data_processing_transformer, integration_authenticator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 36.8%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser, network_poster

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Execute one tool, wait for its result, then proceed to the next.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the tool search results, the `network_fetcher` seems to be the most relevant tool for the first step of the task, which involves fetching unknown input from an API. 

Before executing the `network_fetcher`, let's review its parameters and defaults to ensure we're using it correctly. The `network_fetcher` requires a `source` parameter, which should be the URL of the API we're fetching data from. Given the defaults and guidelines provided, we should use "https://api.example.com/data" as the source URL.

Now, let's execute the `network_fetcher` with the default parameters.

<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
  User: ✅ network_fetcher executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

To search for tools:
<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The next tool to execute is the `data_processing_validator`. However, according to the workflow execution plan, `data_processing_validator` requires `data_processing_parser`. So, the next logical step would be to execute `data_processing_parser` first.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:38:35.770966",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: With the `data_processing_parser` executed successfully, the next step is to execute the `data_processing_validator` as it was the next tool in the sequence that required the parser.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:38:36.864770",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 2,
    "total_tools_executed": 2
  }
}

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:

Turn 8:
  Assistant: With the `data_processing_validator` executed successfully, the next step is to execute the `network_poster` as it is the final tool in the sequence to post the unspecified output.

<tool_call>network_poster</tool_call>
  User: ✅ network_poster executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "network_poster",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T00:39:32.700872",
  "execution_context": {

  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion
