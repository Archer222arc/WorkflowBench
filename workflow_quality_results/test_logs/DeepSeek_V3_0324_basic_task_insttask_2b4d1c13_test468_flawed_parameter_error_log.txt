Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown input data through three tools: read with file_operations_reader, structure with data_processing_parser, and filter with data_processing_filter to generate unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three tools: read with file_operations_reader, structure with data_processing_parser, and filter with data_processing_filter to generate unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_parser for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_filter for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 51%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 58%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 57%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 3/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 55.6%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 4:
  Assistant:             <tool_call>data_processing_parser
  <parameters>
    <source>data/input.json</source>
    <options>{}</options>
  </parameters>
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 38 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_parser tool failed with a TIMEOUT error, I will try an alternative approach by first checking if the data_processing_transformer tool (which was listed in the search results) could serve as a suitable alternative for the parsing step.

<tool_info>data_processing_transformer</tool_info>
  User: Tool Information:

=== data_processing_transformer ===
Description: This tool is designed to transform data from one format to another while applying specific modifications.
Category: data_processing

Parameters:
  - input_format (string): Input data format [REQUIRED]
  - output_format (string): Desired output format [REQUIRED]
  - options (object): Additional options [OPTIONAL] default={}

Returns:
  - success (boolean): Whether operation succeeded
  - transformed_data (object): Transformed data
  - metadata (object): Operation metadata

Possible Errors:
  - INVALID_INPUT: Input validation failed
  - OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed
  - TIMEOUT: Operation timed out

Dependencies: data_processing_parser
  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since the data_processing_transformer has a dependency on data_processing_parser (which already failed), I'll instead try using the data_processing_filter tool which doesn't have this dependency, as it might be able to handle the raw data directly.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter
  <parameters>
    <options>{}</options>
  </parameters>
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since both the parser and filter tools failed, I will now attempt to use the file_operations_writer tool to save the data we initially read, as a fallback solution to complete the task.

<tool_call>file_operations_writer
  <parameters>
    <destination>data/output.json</destination>
    <data>{}</data>
    <options>{}</options>
  </parameters>
</tool_call>
  User: ❌ file_operations_writer failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 42 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 8:
  Assistant: Since all attempts to process the data have failed (parser timeout, filter operation failed, writer timeout), and we've exhausted the main tools in our workflow, I'll conclude the task execution with the current status.

Task completion status: Partially completed
- Successfully executed: file_operations_reader
- Failed to execute subsequent processing steps
- Final output not generated due to tool failures

No further tool calls will be made as we've attempted all relevant tools in the workflow. The task cannot be completed fully in the current environment due to persistent tool failures.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: Task completion status: Failed
- Initial tool (file_operations_reader) failed with timeout error
- Unable to proceed with subsequent processing steps
- All attempted tools failed to execute successfully
- Environment appears unstable with persistent timeout errors

No further tool calls will be made as the task cannot be completed in the current environment. The workflow execution is terminated.
