Description: Process unknown input data through three steps: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter based on criteria to produce unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through three steps: validate its structure, transform formats, and filter based on criteria to produce unspecified output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 28%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 58%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 43.2%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: data_processing_filter, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

You can now use these tools with <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Turn 2:
  Assistant: I need to proceed with the task by executing the tools in the recommended sequence. Since the workflow plan suggests starting with the data_processing_transformer, but it requires the data_processing_parser as a dependency, I should first execute the parser to prepare the input data.

I'll start by executing the data_processing_parser tool to parse the input data from the default location. This will give us structured data for the next steps.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_parser",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T12:14:46.906684",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the data has been parsed into a structured format, I'll proceed to the next step: validating the data structure. I'll use the data_processing_validator tool for this purpose. Since it requires a schema, I'll use a default schema appropriate for JSON data.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_validator executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_validator",

  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: The data validation was successful. Now I'll proceed to the transformation step using the data_processing_transformer tool. This will convert the data to the required format. I'll use the default JSON format for both input and output.

  Note: These tools should be executed before this one

Use <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Turn 8:
  Assistant: The data_processing_aggregator doesn't seem suitable for filtering operations based on its description. Since the data_processing_filter tool failed with an OPERATION_FAILED error, I'll try executing it again with default options as it might have been a transient issue.

<tool_call>data_processing_filter</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_filter failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 45 seconds)

Current progress: 3 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The filtering step failed again with a TIMEOUT error. Since the data_processing_filter tool is consistently failing, I need to find an alternative approach. I'll try using the data_processing_transformer tool again, but this time I'll specify filtering criteria in the transformation options to achieve the filtering and transformation in a single step.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_transformer executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "data_processing_transformer",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T12:15:34.757372",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 5,
    "total_tools_executed": 3
  }
}

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 10:
  Assistant: The transformation step completed successfully again, but I still need to perform the filtering operation. Since the dedicated filtering tool is failing, I'll try using the utility_helper tool as an alternative for filtering operations. I'll execute it with default options to see if it can handle the filtering task.

<tool_call>utility_helper</tool_call>
  User: ❌ utility_helper failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 41 seconds)

Current progress: 4 tools executed. Continue with your task processing.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion
