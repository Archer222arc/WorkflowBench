Timestamp: 2025-08-28T20:37:38.964334

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter', 'data_processing_validator']
Description: Process unknown input data through four tools: read, transform, filter, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a data pipeline task.

    Task: Process unknown input data through four tools: read, transform, filter, and validate, resulting in an unspecified output format.

Task Goals:
1. Read data from the input source
2. Parse and validate the data
3. Transform the data through pipeline stages
4. Write the final result

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 34%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_transformer (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute file_operations_reader (Semantic match: 41%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (85.0%)
4. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 46%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'transform' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 4/4 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 43.6%
- Critical Steps: 4

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_transformer

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 2:
  Assistant: Based on the task requirements and search results, I'll start by reading the input data using the file_operations_reader tool. This is the first step in the pipeline as we need to obtain the raw data before any processing can occur.

I'll use the default parameters:
- source: "data/input.json"
- options: default empty object

<tool_call>file_operations_reader</tool_call>
  User: ✅ file_operations_reader executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",
  "tool": "file_operations_reader",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T20:38:45.115341",
  "execution_context": {
    "step": 0,
    "total_tools_executed": 0
  }
}

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 3:
  Assistant: Now that the input data has been read successfully, the next step is to parse and validate this data. According to the workflow plan, the data_processing_parser tool is required before we can proceed with transformation and validation. I'll execute the parser tool next.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ✅ data_processing_parser executed successfully.
Output: {
  "status": "completed",

  "execution_context": {
    "step": 1,
    "total_tools_executed": 1
  }
}

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 4:
  Assistant: The data has been successfully parsed. The next step in the pipeline is to transform the data. According to the workflow plan, I'll execute the data_processing_transformer tool for this purpose.

<tool_call>data_processing_transformer</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_transformer failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 2 tools executed. Continue with the pipeline execution.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant: The transformation step failed with an OPERATION_FAILED error. Since the workflow plan identified data_processing_transformer as a critical tool, I need to find an alternative transformation tool. I'll search for other transformation tools that might work.
