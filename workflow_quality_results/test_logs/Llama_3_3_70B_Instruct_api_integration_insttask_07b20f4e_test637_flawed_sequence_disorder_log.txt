Description: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate it against a schema, and parse it into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate it against a schema, and parse it into an unspecified format through three processing steps.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute data_processing_validator (Semantic match: 53%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_parser
   - Confidence: High (95.0%)
2. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_parser (Semantic match: 49%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 2/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 50.7%
- Critical Steps: 3

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

I see you're trying to use tools, but I cannot detect any valid action format.
Please use ONE of these formats:

<tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

To execute a tool:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

Example: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT format with angle brackets.

[IMPORTANT: You must use the EXACT XML-style format shown above with angle brackets]

Turn 3:
  Assistant: To execute the first step of the task, which is to fetch data from an API, we will use the `network_fetcher` tool. This tool is suitable for retrieving data from a specified source over the network.

Turn 4:

However, before executing the validator, it's logical to first parse the fetched data. Therefore, we should search for a data processing parser tool or directly execute `data_processing_parser` if it's the next step as per the initial plan.

Given the initial plan, the next step after fetching data is to validate it, but since `data_processing_validator` requires parsed data, we should first ensure the data is in the appropriate format. Thus, we proceed with `data_processing_parser` as it seems to be a prerequisite for validation.
