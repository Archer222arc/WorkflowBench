Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['file_operations_reader', 'data_processing_parser', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unspecified input data through three tools: read with file_operations_reader, extract structure using data_processing_parser, and filter results via data_processing_filter to generate an unspecified output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a basic task task.

    Task: Process unspecified input data through three tools: read with file_operations_reader, extract structure using data_processing_parser, and filter results via data_processing_filter to generate an unspecified output.

Task Goals:
1. Use file_operations_reader to begin processing
2. Apply data_processing_parser for data transformation
3. Complete with data_processing_filter for final output
4. Generate the structured output

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute file_operations_converter
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
2. Execute data_processing_aggregator
   - Confidence: Medium (50.0%)
3. Execute data_processing_filter (Semantic match: 56%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/3 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 56.0%
- Critical Steps: 1

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: file_operations_reader, data_processing_parser

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 9:
  Assistant: The task has been successfully completed by processing the input data through the required steps:

1. **Data Reading & Parsing**: Achieved via `data_processing_parser` (using "data/input.json" as source)
2. **Data Filtering**: Performed by `data_processing_filter`
3. **Output Generation**: Final structured output created by `data_processing_aggregator`

The workflow adapted to initial tool failures by using `data_processing_parser` as an alternative for the first step when file-specific readers failed. All tools executed successfully using default parameters as required.

Final output is available at default location: **data/output.json**

Task complete.
