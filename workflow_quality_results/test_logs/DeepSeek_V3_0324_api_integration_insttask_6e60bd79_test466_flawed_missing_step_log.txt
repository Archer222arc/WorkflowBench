Timestamp: 2025-08-28T02:36:57.757956

Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['network_fetcher', 'data_processing_validator', 'network_poster']
Description: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate it, and post the processed result, ensuring compliance throughout the transformation journey.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a api integration task.

    Task: Integrate an API to fetch unknown data, validate it, and post the processed result, ensuring compliance throughout the transformation journey.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    ## Workflow Execution Plan

    1. Execute network_fetcher
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)
2. Execute network_poster (Semantic match: 32%)
   - Reason: Semantic match for 'full_description' operation
   - Requires: data_processing_transformer, integration_authenticator
   - Confidence: High (80.0%)

### Execution Summary:
- Semantic Search Usage: 1/2 tools
- Average Semantic Score: 31.6%
- Critical Steps: 2

    ### Analysis Results:
    - Tools selected using: Semantic search
    - Critical tools identified: network_fetcher, network_poster

    ### Execution Strategy:
    1. Follow the recommended sequence for optimal results
    2. Use alternatives if primary tools fail
    3. Pay special attention to critical tools
    4. ALWAYS use default parameters - never ask for user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback

    IMPORTANT: Execute tools one by one. After each tool execution, wait for feedback before proceeding.

    REMINDER: This is an automated test. Use the default parameters specified earlier for all tool executions.
    

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.

Turn 4:
  Assistant:             I'll use the data_processing_validator tool to validate the fetched data, as it's the most relevant validation tool. Since we don't have a specific schema, I'll use a generic validation approach.

<tool_call>data_processing_validator</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_validator failed.
Error: OPERATION_FAILED: Operation could not be completed

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 5:
  Assistant:             Since the validation failed, I'll try an alternative approach by first parsing the data before validation. I'll use the data_processing_parser tool to structure the raw data.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 26 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 6:
  Assistant: Since both validation and parsing failed, I'll proceed with the next step in the workflow which is posting the data. I'll use the network_poster tool to send the raw data to the API endpoint.

<tool_call>network_poster</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_poster failed.
Error: INVALID_RESPONSE: Invalid response from server

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 7:
  Assistant: Since all critical tools in the workflow have failed (network_fetcher, data_processing_validator, data_processing_parser, and network_poster), and we've exhausted the main execution path, I'll conclude the task with an error summary.

Task completion status: Failed
Reasons:
1. Initial data fetch completed but subsequent processing failed
2. Data validation attempt failed (OPERATION_FAILED)
3. Data parsing attempt timed out
4. Final posting attempt received invalid server response

No further tools available to attempt recovery. Workflow terminated.

  User: ❌ NO ACTION FOUND - Please take an action.

Your response contains explanations but no actual tool operations.
Stop explaining and START DOING. Use:
<tool_call>tool_name</tool_call> to execute a tool

Execute the first required tool NOW:
<tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>

Turn 8:
  Assistant: <tool_call>network_fetcher</tool_call>
  User: ❌ network_fetcher failed.
Error: INVALID_RESPONSE: Invalid response from server

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.

Turn 9:
  Assistant:             Since the initial network_fetcher failed with an invalid server response, I'll attempt to use an alternative data source by calling the data_processing_parser tool directly with default input.

<tool_call>data_processing_parser</tool_call>
  User: ❌ data_processing_parser failed.
Error: TIMEOUT: Operation timed out (after 28 seconds)

Current progress: 1 tools executed. Continue with the next step.
- If successful, execute the next tool in your workflow
- If failed, consider alternatives or error handling
- If task is complete, indicate completion

Remember: Execute only ONE tool per response.
