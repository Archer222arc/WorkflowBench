[17:43:31.957] 
[17:43:31.957] A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
[17:43:31.957] NumPy 2.2.6 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
[17:43:31.957] versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
[17:43:31.957] Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.
[17:43:31.957] 
[17:43:31.957] If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
[17:43:31.957] downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
[17:43:31.957] We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.
