Task Instance:
----------------------------------------
Required Tools: ['data_processing_validator', 'data_processing_transformer', 'data_processing_filter']
Description: Process unknown data through three steps: validate with the data_processing_validator, transform using data_processing_transformer, and filter via data_processing_filter for optimized output.

Prompt:
----------------------------------------
Execute a simple task task.

    Task: Process unknown data through three steps: validate with the data_processing_validator, transform using data_processing_transformer, and filter via data_processing_filter for optimized output.

    Tool Search Available:
    You have access to a comprehensive tool library with specialized tools for various operations.
    To find relevant tools, use the search command: <tool_search>your search query</tool_search>

    Examples of tool searches:
    - <tool_search>file reader writer</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>data validation parser</tool_search>
    - <tool_search>network api fetch</tool_search>

    After finding the tools you need, execute them using: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>

    IMPORTANT - DEFAULT PARAMETERS:
    Since this is an automated test environment, use these default values when executing tools:
    - For 'source' or file paths: use "data/input.json"
    - For 'destination' or output paths: use "data/output.json"
    - For 'format': use "json"
    - For 'url' or API endpoints: use "https://api.example.com/data"
    - For any other parameters: use reasonable defaults based on the context

    DO NOT ask for any clarification or additional information. Proceed with the task using the defaults above.

    EXECUTION MODE:
    - Execute ONE tool at a time
    - Wait for feedback after each tool execution
    - Based on the feedback, decide what to do next
    - Do NOT list multiple tools to execute - just execute the next one

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task requirements
    2. Search for appropriate tools based on what you need to do
    3. Execute the FIRST tool in your workflow
    4. Wait for feedback
    5. Based on the result, execute the NEXT tool
    6. Continue until the task is complete
    7. Indicate when finished

    

    **Think step by step about which tools to use and why.**

    Please:
    1. First explain your reasoning about which tools to use
    2. Then execute the tools in the order you determined
    3. Format tool calls as: <tool_call>tool_name</tool_call>
    4. Use the default parameters specified earlier - do not ask for any user input
    5. Execute ONE tool at a time and wait for feedback before proceeding

    IMPORTANT EXECUTION RULES:
    - After explaining your reasoning, execute only the FIRST tool
    - Wait for the execution result
    - Based on the feedback, reason about the next step
    - Execute the next tool
    - Continue this pattern until task completion

    REMINDER: This is an automated test environment. Always use default values for parameters:
    - File paths: 'data/input.json' (source), 'data/output.json' (destination)
    - Format: 'json'
    - URLs: 'https://api.example.com/data'

    Begin with "Reasoning:" followed by your thought process, then execute the first tool.

Begin by searching for the first tool you need.
